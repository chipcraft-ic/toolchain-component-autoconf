    Define $as_echo and $as_echo_n for backward compatibility.
    
    Commit 2b59b6f8a79b8bf77e178ff4e5aa0ede433d39cf removed the internal
    shell variables $as_echo and $as_echo_n.  It turns out that these are
    used by several widely-used third-party m4 files (notably both
    gnulib-common.m4 from gnulib, and ax_pthread.m4 from the Autoconf
    macro archive) as well as any number of existing configure.ac’s.
    
    Restore these shell variables, unconditionally defining them to use
    printf.  Issue -Wobsolete warnings if they are used, recommending the
    use of AS_ECHO and AS_ECHO_N respectively.  Add a test which checks
    both that they do work and that they trigger warnings.

    _AS_REEXEC_WITH_SHELL: don’t use AS_EXIT.
    
    If _AS_REEXEC_WITH_SHELL fails to exec the selected “better” shell
    interpreter, and that failure somehow doesn’t terminate the process,
    it calls AS_EXIT([255]).  This expands to an invocation of as_fn_exit.
    However, the definition of as_fn_exit goes into the M4SH-INIT-FN
    diversion, whereas _AS_REEXEC_WITH_SHELL goes into the M4SH-SANITIZE
    diversion, so as_fn_exit won’t be defined at the point of this use.
    We can’t move the definition of as_fn_exit earlier, because we don’t
    know that the shell supports shell functions until after we get to the
    end of the M4SH-SANITIZE diversion.
    
    This is only a theoretical bug because, as the comments say, “all the
    known shells bail out after a failed exec.”  However, a shell that
    doesn’t bail out will instead give the user a flood of nonsensical
    error messages (starting with “as_fn_exit: not found” and then going
    on to choke on the rest of the script) so I think we should fix it
    anyway.  There shouldn’t be any problem with using a plain ‘exit’ at
    this point; no traps are active yet, and we are exiting with an
    explicit error code.

    README-hacking: re-configure from scratch during bootstrap.
    
    When building autoconf from a git checkout, recommend running
    ‘make distclean’ and a second ‘./configure’ after regenerating
    autoconf’s own configure script using the just-built autoconf.
    If one only runs ‘make check’ at that point, some configure-time
    tests will not be repeated using the new code, such as detection
    of a “better” shell.

    Fix `make syntax-check'.
    
    There are two errors caught by make syntax-check currently.
    
    First, the recent make update-copyright
    (d78a7dd95fed24e417dfb4d08124a9ce7c1f7d1e) missed autoconf.texi, I
    think because there are a bunch of .texi files in doc/ whose copyright
    years should *not* be updated (e.g. standards.texi, fdl.texi) and the
    exclusion pattern is too broad.  I can't actually *find* the exclusion
    pattern in the twisty maze of .mk files, all alike, so I just manually
    updated autoconf.texi.
    
    Second, it objects to an edit to an old section of NEWS.  This is
    because of d3dcd5895d64f6c86275c9333e2760a867e540e7, which is a
    legitimate change (replacing http:// with https:// in a URL) so the
    correct action is to change old_NEWS_hash to match.
    
    	* doc/autoconf.texi: Update copyright year.

    	d3dcd5895d64f6c86275c9333e2760a867e540e7.

    doc: Mention effect of 'autoreconf -fi' on INSTALL
    
    Several projects have a bootstrap script that invokes
    'autoreconf -fi' as part of a fresh version control checkout,
    in order to avoid storing common files in version control,
    while also allowing contributors to rerun bootstrap to pick
    up the benefits of any upgrade of one of the autotools.
    
    However, the documentation did not make it obvious that such
    a setup will overwrite any customizations to files like
    INSTALL, if those files are stored in version control, when
    automake still considers that file to be standard based on
    AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE settings.  In such a case, a mere
    'autoreconf -i' is good for the bootstrap script, while a
    separate 'autoreconf -f' is good for picking up on an upgrade
    of any autotools.
    
    * bin/autoreconf.in (help): Mention standard files.
    * doc/autoconf.texi (autoreconf Invocation): Add more text, including
    warning that mixing --force and --install may undo customizations,

    The example text regarding a desired literal AC_DC in output

    it a hard error.  Reword the section to mention the use of
    m4_pattern_allow() as the fix, and beef up the example to

    AC_CHECK_HEADERS_ONCE: hoist CPP name computation to m4 time
    
    Rather than perform a sed script on each element of the
    $ac_header_c_list to compute the corresponding CPP name, we can
    make the list store a series of triples of header names, shell-safe
    names, and CPP names all computed at m4 time.
    
    The resulting configure script is slightly larger based on
    how many headers are checked once, but also performs
    slightly faster.
    
    There is still a sed call in AC_CHECK_HEADER for computing the
    cache variable name; that will be dealt with next.  That patch
    will also be the one that takes advantage of the shell-safe name.

    AC_CHECK_FUNCS_ONCE: hoist CPP name computation to m4 time
    
    Rather than perform a sed script on each element of the
    $ac_func_c_list to compute the corresponding CPP name, we can
    make the list store a series of pairs of function names and
    CPP names all computed at m4 time.
    
    The resulting configure script is slightly larger based on
    how many function names are checked once, but also performs
    slightly faster.
    
    There is still a sed call in AC_CHECK_FUNC for computing the
    cache variable name; that will be dealt with next.

    AC_CHECK_HEADERS_ONCE: honor current AC_LANG
    
    Previously, AC_CHECK_HEADERS_ONCE collected a list of header names
    to check, but ran the checks using the AC_LANG that was active
    during the first encounter of the macro.  In practice, this is
    usually the C language, and we haven't had actual reports of projects
    attempting to use AC_CHECK_HEADERS_ONCE across multiple languages,
    rather this was discovered by code inspection.
    
    With this patch, the code now tracks a separate per-language list of
    names to check.  Note, however, that it is only possible to check for
    a given header name in one language; attempting to add a name again
    under AC_CHECK_HEADERS_ONCE while a different language is active is a
    no-op (this still makes sense because the side-effect of defining
    the CPP macro HAVE_HEADER does not include a language prefix).

    autoconf: refine quadrigraph test in _AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED
    
    It is a very common case that a quadrigraph appears in the argument of
    _AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED, because "#define" is expanded through a quadrigraph.
    Therefore, restrict the quadrigraph tests to "$" (for "$(" and "${")
    and "(" (for "$(").
    
    At the same time, "#" should not be used inside AC_ECHO because it confuses
    m4's comment parsing.  This pre-existing latent bug is caught by test 251:
    
       AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED([bar], [[%!_!# X]])
    
    Previously the quadrigraph in "@%:@define bar %!_!# X" made Autoconf fall back
    to cat anyway.  Now that Autoconf is not fooled by the quadrigraph, the test
    catches that "#" is not special-cased.  Kudos to Eric for coming up with it!
    
    * lib/autoconf/general (_AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED): Do not blindly
    use cat on all quadrigraphs.

    doc: fix an infinitely recursing example
    
    The "single" macro infinitely recurses because its expansion contains
    the unquoted text " single-". The "double" macro almost has the same
    problem, but it is protected by extra quotes. In any case, the macro
    names being repeated in the macro definitions is not necessary.
    
    This commit changes the macro names to "foo" and "bar", which are taken
    from a very similar example in the GNU M4 1.4.17 manual. See lines 1971
    to 1980 of v1.4.17:doc/m4.texi in the GNU M4 Git repository.

    AC_HEADER_MAJOR: port to glibc 2.25
    
    glibc 2.25 is deprecating the namespace pollution of <sys/types.h>
    injecting major(), minor(), and makedev() into the compilation
    environment, with a warning that insists that users include
    <sys/sysmacros.h> instead.  However, because the expansion of
    AC_HEADER_MAJOR didn't bother checking sys/sysmacros.h until
    after probing whether sys/types.h pollutes the namespace, it was
    not defining MAJOR_IN_SYSMACROS, with the result that code
    compiled with -Werror chokes on the deprecation warnings because
    it was not including sysmacros.h.
    
    In addition to fixing autoconf (which only benefits projects
    that rebuild configure after this fix is released), we can also
    give a hint to distros on how they can populate config.site with
    a cache variable to force pre-existing configure scripts without
    the updated macro to behave sanely in the presence of glibc 2.25
    (the documentation is especially useful since that cache variable
    is no longer present in autoconf after this patch).
    
    Note that mingw lacks major/minor/makedev in any of its standard
    headers; for that platform, the behavior of this macro is unchanged
    (code using the recommended include formula will get a compile error
    when trying to use major(), whether before or after this patch); but
    for now, it is assumed that programs actually concerned with
    creating devices are not worried about portability to mingw.  If
    desired, a later patch could tighten AC_HEADER_MAJOR to fail at
    configure time if the macros are unavailable in any of the three
    system headers, but that semantic change is not worth mixing into
    this patch.
    
    * lib/autoconf/headers.m4 (AC_HEADER_MAJOR): Drop check for
    major within sys/types.h; it interferes with the need to check
    sysmacros.h first.
    * doc/autoconf.texi (Particular Headers) <AC_HEADER_MAJOR>: Expand
    details on usage, and on workarounds for non-updated projects.

    lib: use shorter way to test if variable is set
    
    Based on an idea by Bernhard Reutner-Fischer.
    
    We frequently used the idiom of 'test "${var+set}" = set' to
    test if $var was set to a non-empty string, but this can portably
    be trimmed to a more compact 'test ${var+y}' for a smaller
    configure file.  Testing that a variable is not set can be done
    with '${var+false} :' (although the value of $? is not reliably
    1 when the variable is set).
    
    The code for AS_VAR_TEST_SET already used the form '${var+:} false',

    were standardized in POSIX 1003.2-1992, and pre-POSIX systems such
    as SunOS 4 are no longer of practical concern.

    m4sh: allow trailing newlines in shell conditions
    
    Dimitrios Apostolou reported getting a shell syntax error for
    this construct in his configure.ac:
    
    AM_CONDITIONAL([HAVE_LIBXML2],
        [test "x$with_libxml2" != xno &&
         test "x$ac_cv_lib_xml2_xmlFirstElementChild" = xyes]
    )
    
    He analyzed it to a root cause: his trailing newline, coupled
    with an 'if $2; then' construct in the macro body, resulted in
    configure containing:
    if test ... xyes
    ; then
    where the semicolon is a syntax error in shell; and proposed
    a patch to automake to fix his use case.
    
    While that macro is not under our control, it does highlight
    the fact that the shell can use either ; or newline to
    terminate a conditional prior to the next keyword in a compound
    statement.  If we use newline, we gain two benefits - the
    configure file is slightly smaller (more lines, but fewer
    bytes), and any user that doesn't realize that unquoted
    trailing newlines in a macro argument are still significant
    can still generate valid shell code when their argument is
    used in a shell compound statement.
    
    * lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (AS_IF, _AS_IF, _AS_CLEAN_DIR): Prefer
    newline over semicolon to end user-supplied conditionals.

    doc: give an example of using the macro for pkg-config
    
    The autoconf manual doesn't mention any examples of actually
    using m4_pattern_forbid.  Yet this is the perfect macro for
    avoiding the all-too-common failure mode of configure dying with:
    
          checking if libxml2 is present... ./configure: line 11586: syntax
     error
     near unexpected token `LIBXML2,'
          ./configure: line 11586: `PKG_CHECK_MODULES(LIBXML2, libxml-2.0>=
     2.6.19,'
    
    for developers that forgot to install pkg-config.  While we don't
    necessarily advertise the use of PKG_CHECK_MODULES, it is a
    common enough situation that the manual should make it easier to
    help developers learn about missing third-party macros.

       _AC_INCLUDES_DEFAULT_REQUIREMENTS if it hasn't already happened,
       and do nothing else.

    AC_INIT: add --runstatedir option to configure
    
    http://lwn.net/Articles/436012/ documents that many distros
    are now preferring to use /run rather than /var/run for
    storage of pid files and other per-process temporary files
    that must not be cleaned out during arbitrary TMPDIR sweeps.
    As such, the GNU Coding Standards were recently changed to
    recommend a new configure option to make it easy to choose
    this directory at configure time.  This patch adds support
    for the option to all configure scripts built by autoconf.
    
    * general.m4 (_AC_INIT_PARSE_ARGS): Add new directory option.

    doc: mention how to set early defaults
    
    Jonathan Lebon reported an issue to me off-list about a regression
    in libvirt's configure script, which I traced to a patch that
    rearranged code that was checking $with_library compared to the
    AC_ARG_WITH that actually set $with_library [1].  As the whole point
    of the libvirt patch was to refactor code to make maintenance
    easier by hiding the AC_ARG_WITH in a helper macro for a net
    reduction in lines, it makes sense to actually document how to
    check what value a variable has prior to the AC_ARG_WITH usage.
    
    Alas, although the functionality for this has been present in
    autoconf for ages, the documentation has been lacking.

    I forgot one of the fixes Mr. Nakada reported for the 2013-03-08 fix.
    * lib/autoconf/general.m4 (AC_EGREP_CPP):
    Use rm -rf, not just rm -f, when removing conftest*.

    AC_PROG_YACC: don't force Bison to warn against its own features
    
    When invoked with -y/--yacc, Bison warns when its extensions over
    POSIX Yacc are used.  Yet many packages requiring GNU Bison use
    Autoconf/Automake's Yacc support, which passes -y to Bison.  It
    turns out that passing '-o y.tab.c' has exactly the desired
    effect: generating not only y.tab.c but also y.tab.h with -d and
    y.output with -v.  See:
    http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bison-patches/2013-02/msg00100.html
    * lib/autoconf/programs.m4 (AC_PROG_YACC): Use bison -o y.tab.c.
    * NEWS, doc/autoconf.texi: Document this change.

    AC_PROG_CC: also check whether $CC supports "-c -o" together
    
    This is for Automake and its 'subdir-object' mode (see automake bug#13378,
    in particular <http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=13378#73>), so
    we make the new behavior available only if the special witness macro
    '_AM_PROG_CC_C_O_HELPME' is defined (future Automake versions will define
    it).  We might decide, at a later date, to make this behaviour public;
    but then we'll have to discuss its usefulness and design more in depth,
    and if they are agreed upon, adjust the documentation to match, and also
    decide what to do with the macro AC_PROG_CC_C_O, with its similar (but
    slightly incompatible) semantics; since doing so right now would bring us
    off-track (and Automake needs this change *today*, or better, yesterday),
    we proceed with this simpler hack.

    autotest: enable usage of EXEEXT in AT_TESTED
    
    Together with Linux's binfmt-misc feature, Wine can be used to test
    cross-compiled programs as if they were native.  However, the shell
    will not perform the "magic" addition of the .exe extension after a
    program name when searching for an executable.  These simple patches
    let the user work around this by specifying $EXEEXT in the AT_CHECK
    and AT_TESTED argument.  (More care is needed because of carriage
    returns, but this is beyond the scope of this series).

    We are not imposing an new restriction in doing so, since we already
    require Automake 1.11 or later, and that requires Autoconf 2.62.
    Simplify code for symlinking of GNUmakefile in VPATH builds, in
    accordance with the existing "TODO" comments.

    AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS: improve tracing and add sanity checks
    
    Too many legacy tools exist for us to unilaterally quit supporting
    AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR - it is feasible for someone to want their
    package to bootstrap with both automake 1.13 and libtool 2.4.2,
    where the newer automake will only trace the new style of multiple
    directory listings, but the older libtool does a sed and settles
    on the one use of the old name.  So, we let both macros forward
    to a new tracing macro, which also has the benefit of sanitizing
    calls into one directory per trace; we also ensure that the old
    macro is always traced, and appears at most once and before any
    use of the new macro.
    
    * doc/autoconf.texi (Input) <AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS>: Document how
    to trace this macro.
    * lib/autom4te.in (Autoreconf-preselections)
    (Automake-preselections): Preselect this trace.
    * lib/autoconf/general.m4 (AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR_TRACE): New trace.

    warn: allow aclocal to silence m4_require warnings
    
    We introduce a new witness macro, m4_require_silent_probe, for use by
    aclocal during the Autoconf-without-aclocal-m4 language.  This will let
    aclocal process AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS without emitting spurious warnings.
    In fact, if aclocal doesn't suppress require warnings, then, when some macro
    expanded in configure.ac calls AC_REQUIRE on another macro that is defined
    in one of the local m4 macro dirs specified with AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS, the
    *first* autom4te invocation issued by aclocal, not yet being able to "see"
    the m4 macro definitions in the local m4 dirs, will print spurious
    warnings like:
    
        configure.ac:4: warning: MY_BAR is m4_require'd but not m4_defun'd
        configure.ac:3: MY_FOO is expanded from...
    
    Expose the use of this macro in our testsuite.

    AC_SUBST: don't underquote the variable name
    
    Consider the following:
    
    % cat >configure.ac <<'EOF'
    AC_INIT([test], [0])
    
    m4_define([FOO], [baz])
    AC_SUBST([FOO], [bar])
    
    AC_CONFIG_FILES([test])
    AC_OUTPUT
    EOF
    
    % cat >test.in <<'EOF'
    @FOO@
    EOF
    
    This produces no error messages at autoconf time and none at configure
    time.  Nevertheless, the substituted value of FOO is the empty string,
    instead of bar, as expected.  Sure enough, in the output variables
    section of config.log, we see FOO='' instead of FOO='bar'.  Looking
    at the generated configure script, we see that AC_SUBST has produced
    baz=bar in the output, instead of the expected FOO=bar.  But this is
    the only place: everywhere else is still using FOO.

    m4sh: avoid // issues in _AS_PATH_WALK
    
    As reported by Paul Keir on the cygwin lists,
    http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2012-07/msg00263.html,
    some people like to stick / in their $PATH, and if we then try
    to probe $as_dir/progname for existence, we can end up causing
    cygwin to have a several-second timeout per //name probe.  It
    is better to avoid inserting the extra slash when $as_dir is the
    root directory, and simpler to code by always having a trailing
    slash present than it is to strip a trailing slash.  Thankfully,
    _AS_PATH_WALK is an undocumented interface, and even if someone
    was using it in spite of the warnings, their use of $as_dir/foo
    will typically only lead to odd-looking /dir//foo probes, with
    only the case of / in $PATH causing slowdowns, and only when //
    is special.
    
    There was also a minor bug where the if-not-found code of
    _AS_PATH_WALK could be executed with $IFS still in the wrong state.
    
    * lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (_AS_PATH_WALK): Always end as_dir in /.
    Avoid wrong IFS during if-not-found.  Minor optimization to avoid
    regex.

    maint: don't sync elisp-comp or missing from gnulib
    
    Automake 1.13 will be changing the semantics of 'missing'; maintaining
    our own copy in version control risks problems if our version does
    not match automake's expectations.  As a result, gnulib no longer
    mirrors 'missing'.  Furthermore, gnulib originally added the
    'elisp-comp' module with the explanation that autoconf uses it, but
    we don't use it anywhere other than the manner in which automake
    will byte-compile our .el files; since we don't document the script,
    we should be just fine using the version that was installed by automake.

    general: deprecate 'configure.in' as autoconf input
    
    It has been years since that has been deprecated in the documentation,
    in favour of 'configure.ac':
    
      Previous versions of Autoconf promoted the name configure.in, which
      is somewhat ambiguous (the tool needed to process this file is not
      described by its extension), and introduces a slight confusion with
      config.h.in and so on (for which '.in' means "to be processed by
      configure"). Using configure.ac is now preferred.
    
    It's now time to start giving runtime warning about the use of
    'configure.in', so that support for it can be removed in future
    versions of autoconf/automake.
    
    * lib/Autom4te/Configure_ac.pm: Issue a warning in the 'obsolete'
    category if 'configure.in' is detected.  Since this module is synced
    from Automake, this change is to be backported there (and will be
    soon).

    functions: improve cross-compilation guesses for glibc system hosts
    
    Paul and Eric suggested that improving the cross-compilation guesses
    for targets that are glibc systems would be welcome here [1][2].
    
    This patch modifies the cross-compilation behaviour of
      AC_FUNC_CHOWN
      AC_FUNC_GETGROUPS
      AC_FUNC_LSTAT_FOLLOWS_SLASHED_SYMLINK
      AC_FUNC_MALLOC
      AC_FUNC_MMAP
      AC_FUNC_REALLOC
      AC_FUNC_STRCOLL
    so that when the target is a glibc system (or, in case of AC_FUNC_MALLOC
    and AC_FUNC_REALLOC, any known "good" Unix system), the guess is
    "yes it works" rather than "guessing no".
    
    This is important because some of these macros are used in Gnulib, and
    in case of "guessing no" Gnulib provides extra workaround code, and
      1) Generally, when targetting embedded systems, code size should be
         minimized,
      2) In [3], unnecessary workaround code will look like a Glibc bug.
    
    This patch also changes the configure output to "guessing yes" or
    "guessing no" in a case where the ac_cv_* variable is undocumented.

    AC_INIT: remove a transitional warning
    
    On bi-arch systems (such as x86 / x86_64) it is often necessary to pass
    the --host option together with an appropriate value for CC. But this
    triggers a warning:
    
    $ ./configure --host=i686-pc-linux-gnu CC="gcc -m32 -march=i586"
    configure: WARNING: if you wanted to set the --build type, don't use --host.
        If a cross compiler is detected then cross compile mode will be used
    ..
    
    This warning was introduced on 2000-06-30, in commit
    <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=autoconf.git;a=commitdiff;h=cb2e761b8e1181f97e8e09d85526bd22078433db>
    with the remark "Re-enable the old behavior of --host and --build."
    
    This warning was meant to warn users about a changed semantics of
    --build and --host. This change is now 12 years in the past; users
    have had enough time to learn it. I therefore suggest to remove the
    warning.
    
    I've done lots of cross and bi-arch compilations in the last 10 years,
    all with --host and without --build, and have never observed a problem
    with it, except for the warning. Simply relying on config.guess is sufficient.

    branch (with yesterday's commit v1.11-2055-g74a7f49 "maint: drop
    'Automake::Struct' module"): since Automake now requires Perl 5.6,
    that module has become obsolete, being basically just a backport

    tests: fix spurious failure due to Solaris XPG4 sh bug
    
    On Solaris 10, the /usr/xpg4/bin/sh shell seems unable to execute
    a shell script named 'script':
    
      $ touch script
      $ /bin/sh script; echo status: $? # As expected.
      status: 0
      $ /usr/xpg4/bin/sh script; echo status: $? # Weirdness follows.
      /usr/xpg4/bin/sh: script: cannot execute
      status: 1
    
    This was causing a spurious testsuite failure for users which have
    /usr/xpg4/bin in $PATH before /bin and /usr/bin.  Fix that.
    
    * tests/m4sh.at (Configure re-execs self with CONFIG_SHELL): Rename
    the m4sh-produced script to 'script2', to avoid the just-described
    issue.

    m4sh: require that 'test -x' works
    
    4.3BSD is no longer a reasonable portability target; and we are
    pretty sure that these days we can find at least one shell on any
    platform that supports 'test -x'.  Drop a horribly unsafe use of
    eval as a result. :)
    
    Libtool still uses $as_executable_p without so much as calling
    either AS_TEST_X or AS_EXECUTABLE_P; even though the latter has
    existed, although undocumented, since at least 2.59; furthermore,
    libtool uses it in a context where filtering out directories
    would have been desirable.  Shame on them.

    maint: make position of gnulib checkout configurable
    
    Some gnulib-related tools (most prominently, the gnulib-provided
    'bootstrap' script) allow the user to define the position of his
    gnulib's repository checkout through the use of the 'GNULIB_SRCDIR'
    environment variable.  We should do the same, for consistency and
    to easily support slightly unusual layouts in developers' source
    trees.
    
    * cfg.mk (gnulib_dir): Define to "$GNULIB_SRCDIR" if that's set,
    and to default value of "'$(abs_srcdir)'/../gnulib" otherwise.

    build: fix automake error due to missing ChangeLog
    
    Apparently, Automake does not accept the '$(srcdir)/ChangeLog'
    target in Makefile.am as a declaration that ChangeLog is
    automatically generated (and thus does not need to exist at
    automake time).  One has to use a *literal* 'ChangeLog' target.
    
    Problem introduced in commit v2.68-118-g6ed5195 of 2012-01-17,
    "maint: generate ChangeLog from git log".
    
    * Makefile.ma ($(srcdir)/ChangeLog): Renamed ...
    (ChangeLog): ... to this.

    tests: avoid spurious failure for each gnu-fortran-using test
    
    The tests compare pre- and post-run lists of envvars, which must
    be the same, modulo a list of known, filtered-out exceptions.
    However, when running fortran-checking tests with GNU fortran, each
    would fail due to the post-run addition of the GFC symbol added in
    v2.68-97-gbd962ac.
    * tests/local.at (AT_CHECK_ENV): Add GFC to the list of symbols
    that we ignore in pre-/post-run environment diffs.

    maint: generate ChangeLog from git log
    
    Following the practice set by various other GNU projects, we start
    to automatically generate the ChangeLog file from the git commit
    messages.  This will avoid duplication (as the ChangeLog entries
    were always inserted both in the git commit message and in the
    version-controlled ChangeLog file), and potential problems with
    spurious merge conflicts (which, although greatly mitigated by
    Bruno Haible's `git-merge-changelog' helper program, have never
    been completely solved).
    
    * ChangeLog: Moved ...
    * ChangeLog.3: ... to this.
    * build-aux/gitlog-to-changelog: New script, synced from gnulib.
    * cfg.mk (gnulib-update): Also sync gitlog-to-changelog.
    * Makefile.am (gen-ChangeLog): New .PHONY rule, generate the
    ChangeLog for distribution.
    (dist-hook): Depend on it.
    ($(srcdir)/ChangeLog): New dummy rule, to pacify automake "gnu"
    strictness.  Creates a dummy ChangeLog, that will be overridden
    by the proper one at distribution time.
    (gen_start_date): New variable, the date starting from which the
    git log entries are to be copied in the generated ChangeLog.
    (EXTRA_DIST): Add ChangeLog.3 and gitlog-to-changelog.
    * configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_SRCDIR): Use 'lib/autoconf/autoconf.m4'
    instead of 'ChangeLog' as the sentinel file.
    * .gitignore: Add ChangeLog.

    getopt: remove hack for special handling of "-" argument
    
    Older versions of Getopt::Long acted bogusly and died when they
    where configured with the 'bundling' flag and an argument '-' was
    seen on the command line they were parsing.  That is no longer
    the case though, and has not been for quite a long time: the bug
    is no longer present in the 5.6.2 version of perl and the 2.25
    version of Getopt::Long (and today, the latest versions of perl
    and Getopt::Long are respectively 5.14.2 and 2.38).  The obsolete
    workaround for that Getopt::Long bug can thus be removed from our
    'getopt' function.
    
    It is also worth noting that such a workaround was quite buggy
    and brittle itself; for example, a command like this:
      "autom4te --output -"
    would have caused the incorrect diagnostic:
      "autom4te: option `--output' requires an argument"
    Much worse, a command like this:
      "autom4te --language=autoconf --output - configure.ac"
    would have caused the standard input of autom4te to be processed
    and copied into the 'configure.ac' file, deleting its pre-existing
    content!  Surely not what a user would have expected.
    
    After this change, a command like this:
      autom4te --language=autoconf --output - - <configure.ac >out
    works as expected, processing the input from 'configure.ac' and
    writing it to the 'out' file.
    
    * lib/Autom4te/General.pm (use): Require perl version 5.6.2.
    (getopt): Remove the old workaround.

    getopt: fix diagnostic for missing mandatory option argument
    
    Before this change, an incorrect command line usage:
      "autom4te --output"
    triggered broken diagnostic like:
      "autom4te: unrecognized option `--output'"
    instead of the expected and correct:
      "autom4te: option `--output' requires an argument"
    
    * lib/Autom4te/General.pm (getopt): Give correct diagnostic in
    case of usage errors due to missing arguments for options for
    which they are mandatory.  Code basically copied from automake's
    'parse_arguments' private subroutine.

commit 19951ff75b438115dceeb02ab85564028745c45e
Author: Stefano Lattarini <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Aug 16 17:03:11 2011 +0200

    docs: more details about make VPATH rewriting woes
    
    * doc/autoconf.texi (Automatic Rule Rewriting): Solaris make
    VPATH rewriting applies to any whitespace-separated word in a
    rule, so it might apply also to shell variables, functions
    and keywords (and automake has already tripped on this once);
    document this, with an example.  Since we are at it, do some
    minor reformatting of existing text.

commit 7b4918700354b546ae6dd50d0e21eb41f7ad1c96

Date:   Wed Aug 31 23:16:06 2011 -0700

    AC_C_CONST: don't reject gcc -Werror -Wall
    
    * lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_C_CONST): Don't reject gcc when it is used
    with -Werror -Wall during configuring.  It's unwise to use GCC
    that way, but apparently enough people do it nowadays that it's an
    issue.  These days nobody uses the old compilers that the old
    tests reject, so we can't test this fix against them, but it's
    more important to work with modern GCC (even when misused) than to
    work with no-longer-used compilers.  Problem reported by Shevek in
    <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-autoconf/2008-11/msg00007.html>
    and raised again by Dan Kegel in

    autoconf: tune long long tests, particularly for c99
    
    This change is imported from gnulib.
    * lib/autoconf/types.m4 (AC_TYPE_LONG_LONG_INT): Don't bother compiling
    or running anything if c99, or if unsigned long long int does not
    work.  In either case, we know the answer without further tests.
    Do not compile _AC_TYPE_LONG_LONG_SNIPPET twice.  Instead, compile
    it at most once, and use its results for both long long int and
    unsigned long long int.  This is more likely to be efficient in
    the common case where the program wants to check for both long
    long int and unsigned long long int.
    (AC_TYPE_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG_INT): Don't bother compiling if c99,
    since the answer is already known.

    tests: skip broken automake wrapper on MirBSD
    
    On a fresh default install, MirBSD ships with an automake wrapper
    script that has bad behavior:
    
    $ automake --version; echo $?
    Provide an AUTOMAKE_VERSION environment variable, please
    0
    
    * tests/tools.at (autom4te preselections): Skip, rather than fail,
    if 'automake --version' succeeds without printing a version when
    an environment variable is not set.
    * tests/torture.at (Configuring subdirectories)
    (Unusual Automake input files): Likewise.

    Work around DJGPP shell function return bug with command substitutions.
    
    DJGPP bash 2.04 has a bug in that `return $ac_retval' done in a
    shell function which also contains a command substitution causes
    the shell to barf.  For more details and a fix see:
    <http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/mail-archives/browse.cgi?p=djgpp-workers/2009/09/09/03:35:08>
    Possible workaround include putting the `return' in a subshell

    Simplify handling of autotest tracing
    
    This patch simplifies at_fn_check_prepare_trace by noting that it
    need not call at_fn_check_prepare_notrace.  Instead we can make
    $at_traceon be ':' or 'set -x' instead of being empty when tracing
    is disabled.
    
    A similar approach is used for other variables set by
    at_fn_check_prepare_trace and to conditionalize the message
    about disabling tracing in at_fn_check_prepare_dynamic.
    
    In addition, I changed $at_traceoff to 'set +x' throughout and
    eliminated the variable.

    These are lightweight versions of AT_CHECK that automatically
    add the equivalent of ! in front of the command and change a

    More reliable signal handling in Autotest.
    
    * lib/autotest/general.m4 (Driver loop): Rewrite signal handler.
    Start parallel jobs in their own process group, enabling job
    control in the shell if possible, for better signal handling.
    Deal with INT, TERM, and HUP in the testsuite driver.  In the
    parallel driver, propagate TSTP to jobs either as TSTP or as
    STOP (to avoid fork bombs with ksh).
    Inside the job processes, add PIPE handler to write back the
    job token, so the master process does not hang.
    Disable the parallel driver if job control is not provided or if
    trap does not understand signal names.
    * tests/autotest.at (parallel autotest and signals): New test,
    exercises INT, TERM, and PIPE, serial and parallel, with and

    Fix testsuite program wrapper for whitespace in `pwd`.
    
    The problem here is that the usual mantra is that command
    variables can contain arguments, thus we cannot just escape
    $AUTOCONF, $AUTOM4TE etc.  The compromise is to put the
    $top_builddir/tests directory early in $PATH, so that the
    wrappers are found by their plain name.
    
    * tests/wrapper.as: Put $testdir early in $PATH.
    (AUTOCONF, AUTOHEADER, AUTOM4TE): Set to plain command names.

    Proper file name escaping in Autoconf programs and Perl modules.
    
    This includes escaping of characters special to the shell
    as well as special to Perl, e.g., leading `<' or `>'.

    wrongly tries to append to a different file.

Date:   Sun Nov 18 14:03:06 2007 +0100

    Diagnose and guard against write errors dealing with config.status.
    
    The general idea is this: all write failures from `configure'
    writing `config.status' are indicated by $ac_write_error, which
    is only checked at the end.  This is safe because config.status
    code is not executed before the file is complete.  Other write
    failures, be they inside config.status, or in sub shell/awk
    scripts spawned from configure or config.status, typically need
    earlier checking, as their results are used right afterwards.
    * lib/autoconf/status.m4 (AC_OUTPUT): Initialize `ac_write_fail'
    before writing config.status, check afterwards.
    (_AC_OUTPUT_FILES_PREPARE, _AC_OUTPUT_FILE)
    (_AC_OUTPUT_HEADERS_PREPARE,_AC_OUTPUT_CONFIG_STATUS):
    Set `ac_write_error' for write failures to config.status.  Barf

    Avoid error with Tru64 awk and testsuite lines with many words.
    
    * lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): In the awk script that
    reads the testsuite, set the field separator to an unusual value,
    in order to not run over the limit of 199 fields.  Tru64 4.0D awk
    even splits the input if $i, i>0, was never accessed in the script.

    * man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Now that scripts in bin/ and tests/

    Make inter-release --version output more useful.
    
    Now, each unofficial build has a version "number" like 2.61a-19-58dd,
    which indicates that it is built using the 19th change set
    (in _some_ repository) following the "v2.61a" tag, and that 58dd
    is a prefix of the commit SHA1.
    * build-aux/git-version-gen: New file.
    * configure.ac: Run it to set the version.
    (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Don't check NEWS here.
    * Makefile.am (dist-hook): Arrange so that .version appears only
    in distribution tarballs, never in a checked-out repository.
    * .gitignore: Add .version here, too.  Just in case.
    * tests/Makefile.am ($(srcdir)/package.m4): Depend on Makefile,
    not configure.ac, now that the version number changes automatically.
    
    Ensure that $(VERSION) is up to date for dist-related targets.
    * GNUmakefile: Arrange to rerun autoconf, if the version reported by
    git-version-gen doesn't match $(VERSION), but only for dist targets.

    This lets people use function types and so forth.
    For C++ there doesn't seem to be a simple solution, so leave it alone.

    behavior when the same variable has multiple AC_DEFINEs.
    * lib/autoconf/fortran.m4 (_AC_FC_WRAPPERS): Revert to the
    old implementation which AC_DEFINEs the FC_FUNC and FC_FUNC_

    --recheck' failure if ac_configure_args doesn't contain a leading
    space.  This works around a problem with the XEmacs configure.ac,
    which uses the (undocumented) ac_configure_args variable
    inconsistently with Autoconf.

    * lib/autoconf/functions.m4 (AC_FUNC_MKTIME):
    Include <limits.h>, and use its INT_MAX to rewrite the
    j loop so that it does not overflow 'int'.  Problem reported by
    Ralf Wildenhues in
    <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2006-12/msg00084.html>.
    Play it safe by shifting left by 1 rather than multiplying by 2,
    as GCC is less likely to optimize this away when the value
    is signed (when it assumes overflow leads to undefined behavior).
    Also, don't assume time_t uses two's complement.

    * lib/autoconf/c.m4 (_AC_PROG_CC_C89): Also try -xc99=all, for Sun
    C 5.8 on Solaris 10.  Using -xc99=all rather than -xc99 bypasses
    the buggy -xc99 option of Forte Developer 7 C on Solaris 9.

    * lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_FILES_PREPARE): When
    creating the awk substitution script, handle one input line at a
    time, so that the maximum length of a substituted (multi-line)
    value is not limited by the size of the sed pattern space.
    The trade-off is a slightly repetitive sed script.
    * doc/autoconf.texi (Limitations of Usual Tools): Branch labels
    can only have up to 7 characters, due to Solaris 10 /bin/sed.
    * tests/torture.at (Substitute a 2000-byte string): Increase the
    test with several long lines, they should not be caught by sed
    limits any more.

    Fix shell expansion errors by using /usr/ucb/echo always;
    avoid an error on systems without it by another subshell.
    Avoid m4 expansion of `$1'.  Set the zeroth argument of the

    Rewrite config files generation: avoid quadratic growth in
    the number of substituted variables by using awk instead of sed
    for the bulk of the substitutions.
    * NEWS: Mention this.
    * doc/autoconf.texi (Setting Output Variables): `|#_!!_#|' is also
    forbidden in the output (and thus input) file.
    * lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_AWK_LITERAL_LIMIT): New macro.
    (_AC_OUTPUT_FILES_PREPARE): Instead of several sed scripts,
    generate just one large awk script for substitutions,
    eliminating much of the earlier complexity, while adding some
    new complexity.  Only expand the substitution templates at
    configure time, for smaller configure script size.  If
    _AC_SUBST_FILES are used, test 'awk' for working getline support
    at config.status time.  If absent, interpolate through the
    shell.  The awk script was written with much help
    from Paolo Bonzini and Paul Eggert.
    (_AC_SED_CMD_NUM, _AC_SED_DELIM_NUM, _AC_SED_FRAG): Removed.

    * tests/torture.at (Substitute a 2000-byte string): Also
    substitute a line with 1000 words, and a variable with several
    long lines.
    (Substitute and define special characters): Test awk special
    characters, and put substitution input strings `@foo@' in the
    output, to test that no recursion happens; test several other
    combinations from Paolo Bonzini.

    * build-aux/install-sh (posix_mkdir): Reject FreeBSD 6.1 mkdir -p -m,
    which incorrectly sets the mode of an existing destination
    directory.  In some cases the unpatched install-sh could do the

    system.  We hope this is rare in practice, but it's clearly worth
    fixing.  Problem reported by Alex Unleashed in
    <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-autoconf/2006-10/msg00012.html>.
    Also, don't bother to check for -m bugs unless we're using -m;

    (AS_EXECUTABLE_P): Use as_test_x rather than as_executable_p.
    (_AS_TEST_PREPARE): Set as_test_x rather than as_executable_p.
    Use a better substitute, by inspecting the output of "ls"
    rather than just using ":".
    * lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_LINK_IFELSE): Use AS_TEST_X
    rather than AS_EXECUTABLE_P, since we needn't worry about

    * lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_PREPROC_IFELSE): Don't
    set ac_cpp_err to 'yesyes' if preproc_warn_flag and werror_flag
    are both 'yes'.  In fact, don't bother setting ac_cpp_err at all;
    nobody uses it.
    (_AC_COMPILE_IFELSE, _AC_LINK_IFELSE): Don't log our funky tests
    with werror_flag and conftest.err and so forth.  This is more
    compatible with how _AC_PROG_PREPROC_WORKS_IFELSE behaves,
    and anyway the user shouldn't normally want to see this gorp logged.
    Problem reported by Ralf Wildenhues.
    * lib/autoconf/lang.m4 (AC_LANG_WERROR): werror_flag's default is
    empty, not 'no', since the rest of the code uses 'test -z'.

    Fix Lex library problem reported to us by Julio Garvia.
    * doc/autoconf.texi (Particular Programs): YYTEXT_POINTER is
    for the default, which the user can override.
    * lib/autoconf/programs.m4 (AC_PROG_LEX): Let _AC_PROG_LEX_YYTEXT_DECL
    deal with LEXLIB.
    (_AC_PROG_LEX_YYTEXT_DECL): Handle caching correctly; the old code
    didn't work if some values were cached but not others.  Test for
    broken lex libraries like native ia64-hp-hpux11.22; see
    <http://sources.redhat.com/ml/binutils/2003-12/msg00337.html>, and
    work around the problem by preferring an empty LEXLIB to -lfl or
    -ll.  Let the user set LEXLIB='' to indicate no library needed.

Date:   Fri Jul 7 17:56:16 2006 +0000

    * tests/torture.at (Configuring subdirectories): Set CONFIG_SITE
    more globally, since the 2006-06-30 patch didn't suffice.  Problem
    reported by Keith Marshall.  Also, don't bother with builddir2,
    since it shouldn't be needed any more.

    * tests/torture.at (Configuring subdirectories): Set CONFIG_SITE
    to a nonexistent file, so that we don't have to worry about
    a local site configuration that doesn't use /usr/local.
    Problem reported by Keith Marshall in

commit 60dc5a14da84076c17b95ddbe3e58a8e21ab3e05
Author: Paul Eggert <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
Date:   Wed Jun 28 17:48:52 2006 +0000

    * doc/autoconf.texi: Be more consistent about using @acronym with
    "HP" and "HP-UX".  Remove mention of OSF; the old version wasn't
    quite right (it talked about "OSF/Tru64", even though the
    operating systems were called OSF/1, Digital UNIX, and Tru64 UNIX,
    and it even mentioned "OSF 4"!) and at this point there's little
    reason to talk about OSF any more, since it died in 1994.
    (Specific Compiler Characteristics): Simplify example of
    negative-size array.
    (File Descriptors): Reorder to make the text flow better.
    Remove joke about "appreciate the various levels"; I didn't get it.
    Add remark about HP-UX sh -x bug with stderr noted by Bob Proulx in
    <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2006-06/msg00225.html>.
    (File Descriptors, Limitations of Usual Tools):
    Tone down the advice against renaming or removing open files.
    (Limitations of Usual Tools): Add a new section, on 'rm'.

    * lib/m4sugar/m4sugar.m4 (m4_init): Merge the two m4_wrap
    calls, so that we do not care whether they are LIFO or FIFO;
    in the m4_wrap, do not check which diversion is the topmost
    one, just check that the stack is balanced at the end.
    * lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (AS_INIT): We are going to change the
    base diversion forever--pop the previous diversion before
    opening the new one; consequently, remove the m4_wrap call.
    * lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): Likewise.
    * tests/m4sugar.at: Do not use
    m4_wrap([m4_diversion_pop([..])]), for educational purposes.

    Reword slightly to clarify.  Generalize advice about

    vars, not just VPATH.
    (Special Chars in Variables): Warn about special characters in
    $(srcdir) too.
    (Assignments): Clarify default-value example as suggested by
    Ralf Wildenhues in

Author: Paul Eggert <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
Date:   Wed Jun 14 05:08:20 2006 +0000

    * doc/autoconf.texi: Some systematic minor improvements, as
    follows.  Use "makefile" when talking about makefiles
    generally (which might be named "makefile" or "Makefile" or even
    "foo.mk"), "Makefile" when talking about a specific makefile
    called "Makefile".  This unclutters the text from weird quotes
    (e.g., "`Makefile's" in info mode).  Similarly, use "@var{foo}
    values" rather than "@var{foo}s" and similar constructs containing
    "}s".  Use "Make rules" rather than "Makefile rules".  Minor
    English-language improvements.  Change the prefix "sub-" to "sub"
    and "re-" to "re".
    Put blank lines around examples more consistently.
    Avoid "rather" and "very" as intensifiers.
    Avoid "will" as an auxiliary.
    (Limitations of Make): Split this node into....
    (Portable Make, $< in Ordinary Make Rules, Failure in Make Rules):
    (Leading _ in Macro Names, Backslash-Newline-Newline):
    (Backslash-Newline Comments, Long Lines in Makefiles):
    (Macros and Submakes, The Make Macro SHELL, Comments in Make Rules):
    (obj/ and Make, make -k Status, VPATH and Make):
    (VPATH and Double-colon, $< in Explicit Rules):
    (Automatic Rule Rewriting, OSF/Tru64 Directory Magic):
    (Make Target Lookup, Single Suffix Rules, Timestamps and Make):
    New nodes, resulting from splitup of Limitations of Make.
    All cross-references changed.  Raise the top node from
    a section to a chapter, and all subnodes accordingly.
    Redo the introductory wording to match the new organization.
    (Installation Directory Variables): Use an example that is
    closer to what Autoconf actually does.  Mention that VPATH's
    value should not contain metacharacters or white space.
    (Fortran Compiler): Fix a VPATH bug in an example.
    (Leading _ in Macro Names): Mention that this problem is no longer
    of practical concern.
    (VPATH and Make): Reword the advice to make it clearer
    that Autoconf and Automake support VPATH in non-GNU make, but
    many packages have bugs in this area.
    ($< in Explicit Rules): Refer to Build Directories rather
    than using a (non-VPATH-safe) example.
    (Automatic Rule Rewriting): Mention the sort of disaster that
    can ensue with Solaris-style rule rewriting with VPATH.

    * NEWS: GNU make now recommended for VPATH builds.
    Mention that some macros are now documented to be obsolescent.
    * doc/autoconf.texi:
    Prefer "current" to "modern" to describe
    currently-used (albeit perhaps old-fashioned) hosts.
    Mention which ancient features no longer need to be worried about.
    setgid -> set-group-ID

    (Limitations of Make): Modernize discussion of VPATH builds.
    Mention $? as a workaround in some cases.
    * doc/install.texi (Basic Installation):
    Mention "./configure; make; make install" first.  Be more
    specific about why this file is generic.  Remove unnecessary
    parens.  Remove misleading "only".  Remove obsolete advice
    about csh.  Don't say "configure" takes awhile; say it
    might take a while.  Suggest CFLAGS=-g rather than CFLAGS=-O2,
    and CC=c99 rather than CC=c89, as these are blessed by current
    Posix.  Recommend GNU make if doing a VPATH build.

    * doc/autoconf.texi (Particular Programs, Limitations of Usual Tools):
    Use better wording to talk about AC_PROG_MKDIR_P's thread-safety.
    Don't use the term "thread-safe" to talk about mkdir race
    conditions, since the problem is more a process than a thread
    issue.  Problem reported by Stepan Kasal in:
    http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-patches/2006-05/msg00088.html
    * lib/autoconf/programs.m4 (AC_PROG_MKDIR_P): Use code that mimics
    the test for 'install' more closely.  Look at MKDIR_P first.
    Look in the PATH, and at /opt/sfw/bin.
    Look for a 'gmkdir' program as well (Solaris 10 /opt/sfw/bin/gmkdir).
    Don't bother to try mkdir -p, since we already check mkdir --version;
    just look at the version number.  (There's no easy way to check
    for race-free implementations.)
    * tests/tools.at (autoconf: subdirectories): Adjust to above
    changes, since MKDIR_P now might end in "/mkdir -p".

    (AC_TRY_EVAL, AC_TRY_COMMAND): Mention that these macros might get
    removed.

Date:   Fri May 26 17:25:35 2006 +0000

    * lib/autoconf/lang.m4 (_AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_DEFAULT): Drop the
    initialization of `ac_cv_exeext', do not override it if it was
    already set, unless it was set to `no', for compatibility with
    Autoconf-2.13, and comment this.
    Do not export `ac_cv_exeext', Libtool hasn't needed this for years.
    (_AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_DEFAULT): Likewise, do not export it.
    (_AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_WORKS, _AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_CROSS): Typos.
    * doc/autoconf.texi (Compilers and Preprocessors) <EXEEXT>:
    Document that this test may be overridden by setting
    `ac_cv_exeext'.

    Revert these two patches:
    
    2006-04-06  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>
    * lib/autoconf/lang.m4 (_AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_O): Inside cache
    check, s/ac_exeext/ac_cv_exeext/.  Fixes regression introduced
    2006-04-01.
    
    2006-04-01  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>
    Clean up _AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT* macros.
    * lib/autoconf/lang.m4 (_AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_DEFAULT): Don't try to
      detect exeext, it will be done by _AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_O; just set
      ac_file to the name of the default output file and call
      _AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_WORKS.  Move the definition of ac_files and the
      initial `rm' of the candidate files...
    (_AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT): ... here and simplify them.  Moreover, use
      the same list in subsequent `rm' calls, and for the temporary
      redefinition of ac_clean_files; call _AC_COMPILER_OBJEXT at the end,
      and don't call the other _AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_* macros directly, use...
    (_AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_TESTS): ... this new macro.
    (_AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_O): Don't export ac_cv_exeext, it's not needed (or
      no longer needed) by libtool.  Make it a cache check.
    (_AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_CROSS): Remove the comment, it was obviously
      copied here by mistake.
    (AC_NO_EXECUTABLES): Redefine _AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT_TESTS, not
      _AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT.
    * lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_PROG_CC, AC_PROG_CXX, AC_PROG_OBJC): Do not call
      _AC_COMPILER_OBJEXT directly.
    * lib/autoconf/fortran.m4 (_AC_PROG_FC): Likewise.

    Fix a bug in the previous patch: it assumed that echo '...\...' had
    the BSD interpretation rather than the SysV interpretation.  Use
    a short here-document instead.

Author: Paul Eggert <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
Date:   Tue May 23 23:07:50 2006 +0000

    * lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_HEADER): Don't use shell
    expansion in the here-documents used by config.status, as that
    runs afoul of the Korn shell version M-12/28/93d bug described in
    the Autoconf manual, and this in turn causes a Coreutils 5.95 build to
    fail as described by Tim Rice and diagnosed by Ralf Wildenhues in
    <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-autoconf/2006-05/msg00082.html>.

    * lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_HEADER): Simplify ac_dA and
    ac_dB slightly, to save bytes in the script.
    Max out at 50 lines, rather than 96; this is more likely
    (though not guaranteed) to avoid obscure 'sed' failures.

    * doc/autoconf.texi (Particular Programs): Do not promise that
    we always prefer the GNU version of the program, and that we
    search according to PATH; both rules can have exceptions.
    Update description of AC_PROG_GREP, AC_PROG_EGREP, AC_PROG_FGREP,
    AC_PROG_SED.  Move descriptions of limitations
    to the Limitations of Usual Tools section.
    (Limitations of Usual Tools) <sed>: Mention script length
    limitations with Solaris /usr/ucb/sed.
    <grep>: Fix wording for empty alternative.  Mention that -c and
    -l should not be combined, and that -E and -F should not be
    combined.

Date:   Mon May 22 04:45:03 2006 +0000

    * lib/autoconf/functions.m4 (AC_FUNC_GETMNTENT):
    Import the following fix from coreutils:
    
    2006-01-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>
    
    Invoke AC_CHECK_FUNCS(getmntent) unconditionally so that tests of
    $ac_cv_func_getmntent (e.g., in gl_LIST_MOUNTED_FILE_SYSTEMS) need
    not double-quote uses of that variable, to accommodate the rare
    case in which getmntent is available in none of the libraries
    checked.  This happens at least on FreeBSD 5.0.

    * lib/autoconf/general.m4 (AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIRS): Bring back
    ac_config_guess, ac_config_sub, and ac_configure, since evidently
    some other programs unwisely rely on these undocumented vars.
    But put in warning comments about them.
    Problem reported by Ralf Wildenhues in

    (AC_PROG_MKDIR_P): Fall back on $ac_install_sh, not $INSTALL, so
    that we don't require $INSTALL to be thread-safe.  Move comments
    out of generated code.  Require AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR_DEFAULT instead
    of AC_PROG_INSTALL.  Output a message saying that we're checking

    (Particular Programs): AC_PROG_MKDIR_P falls back on $INSTALL, not
    necessarily install-sh.

commit 0f696b8be5cd711b46ded7817975f60ceb215ef9
Author: Paul Eggert <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
Date:   Wed May 10 23:05:15 2006 +0000

    * NEWS: New macro AC_PROG__MKDIR_P.  AS_MKDIR_P is now more robust.
    * config/install-sh: Don't use 'path' to talk about file names,
    as per GNU coding standards.  Close a race condition reported by Ralf
    Wildenhues and Stepan Kasal.  There is still a race condition
    on hosts that predate POSIX 1003.1-1992, but we can't help this.
    Don't mishandle weird characters like space on pre-POSIX hosts.
    Invoke mkdir at most once per dir arg on pre-POSIX hosts.
    * doc/autoconf.texi (Programming in M4sh): Cross-reference to
    AC_PROG_MKDIR_P from AS_MKDIR_P.
    (Limitations of Usual Tools): Cross-reference to AC_PROG_MKDIR_P
    from mkdir.  Mention that Autoconf 2.60 install-sh is safe but
    earlier editions are not (including Automake 1.8.3).
    Do not suggest mkinstalldirs for thread-safety.
    * lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (AS_MKDIR_P): Make it more robust in the
    presence of special characters and race conditions.
    * tests/local.at (AT_CHECK_ENV): Add mkdir_p to the list of variables
    in Autoconf's name space.
    
    * lib/autoconf/programs.m4 (AC_PROG_MKDIR_P): New macro, taken
    from Automake with minor changes.
    * doc/autoconf.texi (Particular Programs): Document AC_PROG_MKDIR_P.

    * tests/Makefile.am (AUTOTEST): Use `$(MY_AUTOM4TE)' instead of
    `./autom4te' to create `./testsuite', since the `all' target
    will ensure its presence, but `installcheck' should not create
    the uninstalled wrappers.

    * lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_PROG_CC_STDC): If ac_cv_prog_cc_stdc

    special characters.

    * lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_PREPARE): When we escape
    single quotes, we only need to search for single quotes; this
    both simplifies the search pattern, and makes us less
    susceptible to `echo' variations for arguments not containing
    single quotes.
    (_AC_ARG_VAR_VALIDATE): Likewise.

    * doc/autoconf.texi (Programming in M4sh): Remove mention of
    AS_VAR_SET_BASENAME, AS_VAR_SET_DIRNAME, and AS_BASENAME.
    We have to keep AS_DIRNAME since it was part of a stable Autoconf,
    but AS_BASENAME doesn't have to be supported.

    * NEWS: Remove AS_DIRNAME and AS_BASENAME, replacing them with
    AS_VAR_SET_DIRNAME and AS_VAR_SET_BASENAME.
    * doc/autoconf.texi (Programming in M4sh): Document this.  All uses
    changed.  The newer interfaces are more reliable, as they allow
    implementations that handle trailing newline correctly.  For now,
    we're in a freeze, so I did not include the more-reliable
    implementations, but I wanted to correct the interface before 2.60
    goes out.
    * lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (_AS_DETECT_REQUIRED): Renamed from
    AS_DETECT_REQUIRED.  All uses changed.
    (_AS_DETECT_SUGGESTED): Renamed from AS_DETECT_SUGGESTED.
    All uses changed.

    (_AS_DIRNAME_SED): Renamed from AS_DIRNAME_SED.  All uses changed.
    Use "dirname --".
    (AS_VAR_SET_BASENAME, AS_VAR_SET_DIRNAME): New macros.
    * tests/m4sh.at (AS_VAR_SET_DIRNAME): Renamed from AS_DIRNAME.
    Test the new API.  Don't test internals, since they're probably
    going to change anyway.
    (AS_VAR_SET_BASENAME): Likewise, renamed from AS_BASENAME.
    
    * bin/autoconf.as: Don't use AS_BASENAME or AS_DIRNAME.  This
    removes a bootstrapping problem with the changes described above.
    The AS_DIRNAME part wasn't used, anyway, and the AS_BASENAME
    part can be done portably without all the deep Autoconf magic.

    * configure.ac (ac_cv_sh_n_works): Don't try to test for it, since
    some shells (e.g., Solaris 8 /bin/sh) implement it verrrry slowly.
    Instead, just list the shells that we know work.
    * tests/local.at (AT_CHECK_SHELL_SYNTAX): Remove 2nd arg.  All uses
    changed.  Be more cautious about the _cv_ variable.
    * tests/tools.at (Syntax of the shell scripts): Check the
    _cv_ variable once, at first, to avoid an internal autoconf error
    when sh -n does not work.

    * lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_CONFIG_LOG): Don't
    use ">&-" since we're only 99.999% sure that this is portable,
    and since the MinGW bug is fixed in a different way.
    * lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): Likewise.
    
    * lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_CONFIG_STATUS): Handle --recheck
    before opening config.log, to avoid hitting a bug on MinGW.

    * lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_CONFIG_LOG): Close
    AS_MESSAGE_LOG_FD before reopening it onto the log file.
    This works around a MinGW bug reported by Eric Paire.
    Make sure that all writes to the log file append to it,
    rather than possibly losing data.
    * lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): Likewise.

    succeeded, but `ln -s file dir' failed, take care to remove the
    leftover target before the next test, to prevent its spurious
    failure; also make sure `ln file dir' works before selecting it.

    (Debugging a successful test, Debugging script and environment),
    (Debugging a failed test): ...these new tests.  The first of these
    is fixed by...
    * lib/autotest/general.m4 (_AT_CREATE_DEBUGGING_SCRIPT): New
    macro, split out from...
    (AT_INIT): ...here, so that using -d also generates a run script.
    Document that -d inhibits top-level logging.
    * doc/autoconf.texi (testsuite Invocation): Document that -d only
    inhibits top-level logging; debug scripts are created.

    * lib/freeze.mk: Fix typo in comment.  Unlike the last, white
    space only patch to this file, this patch causes the Makefile.in
    files that include freeze.mk to be updated, and thus have a
    newer time stamp again, which in turn makes a pristine CVS
    checkout have correct time stamps.

    correctly.
    * Makefile.cfg (executable-update): Use `chmod a+x' instead of
    `chmod +x'.
    (wget_files): Update config.guess, config.sub, texinfo.tex by
    `wget-update', now that their URLs work again.

    * lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (_AS_LN_S_PREPARE): MSYS `ln -s' fails
    with a target directory; it's internally implemented as `cp'
    anyway, but since Autoconf advertises the possibility to use
    a target directory when LN_S is `ln -s', we need to find out.

    * lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_PREPARE): Use '\'' for an
    apostrophe within a single-quoted string, as this is the usual
    tradition and is easier to read than '"'"'.  Don't rely on the
    shell treating "$/" like '$/'.  Use a more-consistent indenting
    style for the trap.

commit 31d0e60498b82939d84b0ad223c5c765e587260f
Author: Ralf Wildenhues <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>
Date:   Thu Apr 6 18:16:56 2006 +0000

    * lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_CACHE_DUMP): Fix the detection of
    whether `set' quotes correctly: redirect stderr of the tested
    `set', and use a subshell, for Ultrix; use `sed' instead of
    `grep' for zsh `set' which may write binary output; match only
    at the beginning of a line, to avoid false positives.
    In order to avoid false positives by unrelated variables with
    multiline content, put the dump algorithm in a subshell and
    unset all variables containing newlines (except some which are
    special to the shell).  Warn about cache variables that are
    unset.

    Update from Bison.

Author: Paul Eggert <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
Date:   Mon Jul 25 18:10:25 2005 +0000

    Rewrite substantial part of lib/autoconf/status.m4.
    The main change is that CONFIG_FILES, CONFIG_HEADERS, CONFIG_LINKS,
    and CONFIG_COMMANDS are not processed in four separate loops.
    Instead, there is one main loop.  This alows that the common code
    is expanded only once, thus config.status (and configure) is smaller.
    
    The registration mechnism in AC_CONFIG_FILES and cousins also changed;
    the AC_LIST_FILES and cousins macros are no longer used.
    
    * lib/autoconf/status.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_FILES, _AC_OUTPUT_HEADERS,
    _AC_OUTPUT_LINKS, _AC_OUTPUT_COMMANDS): Renamed to ...
    (_AC_OUTPUT_FILE, _AC_OUTPUT_HEADER, _AC_OUTPUT_LINK,
    _AC_OUTPUT_COMMAND): ..., respectively.  These macros no longer
    contains the initialization, nor the for loop, nor the associated
    commands; all these go to ...
    (_AC_OUTPUT_MAIN_LOOP): ... this new macro, called from
    _AC_OUTPUT_CONFIG_STATUS.
    (_AC_CONFIG_SPLIT, _AC_CONFIG_SPLIT_SOURCE_DEST, _AC_CONFIG_SPLIT_FILE_IN):
    Nuked; the code was merged into _AC_OUTPUT_MAIN_LOOP.
    (_AC_OUTPUT_FILE): The creation of the sed script ...
    (AC_OUTPUT): ... and the setup of ac_vpsub goes to ...
    (_AC_OUTPUT_FILES_PREPARE): ... a new macro, also called from
    _AC_OUTPUT_MAIN_LOOP.
    (_AC_CONFIG_FILES, _AC_CONFIG_HEADERS, _AC_CONFIG_LINKS,
    _AC_CONFIG_COMMANDS): Use ...
    (_AC_CONFIG_FOOS): ... this new macro, which uses these ...
    (_AC_CONFIG_REGISTER, _AC_CONFIG_REGISTER_DEST): ... new macros.
    (_AC_CONFIG_FILE, _AC_CONFIG_HEADER, _AC_CONFIG_LINK,
    _AC_CONFIG_COMMAND, _AC_CONFIG_DEPENDENCIES): No longer needed.
    (_AC_CONFIG_DEPENDENCY): Update, it uses these ...
    (_AC_CONFIG_DEPENDENCY_DEFAULT, _AC_FILE_DEPENDENCY_TRACE_COLON):
    ... new macros.
    (_AC_CONFIG_UNIQUE): Update.
    (AC_LIST_FILES, AC_LIST_HEADERS, AC_LIST_LINKS, AC_LIST_COMMANDS):
    Replaced by this ...
    (_AC_LIST_TAGS): ... new common macro.
    (AC_LIST_FILE_COMMANDS, AC_LIST_HEADER_COMMANDS, AC_LIST_LINK_COMMANDS,
    AC_LIST_COMMAND_COMMANDS): Replaced by this ...
    (_AC_LIST_TAG_COMMANDS): ... new common macro.
    (_AC_CONFIG_COMMANDS_INIT): Moved top to the `registration' section;
    this didn't belong to the `config commands' section.
    (_AC_OUTPUT_COMMANDS_INIT): Don't initialize, m4_ifdef is our friend.
    (AC_CONFIG_COMMANDS_PRE, AC_OUTPUT_COMMANDS_PRE,
    AC_CONFIG_COMMANDS_POST): Moved to a new section, these didn't belong
    to the `config commands' section either.
    (AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS): Don't touch diversion DEFAULTS.
    (_AC_LIST_SUBDIRS): Don't initialize, m4_ifdef is our friend.
    
    ... and many changes to the comments nearby.
    
    * lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_DEFAULTS): At the end of the day,
    set ac_subdirs_all='_AC_LIST_SUBDIRS'.
    * tests/torture.at (AC_CONFIG_FILES, HEADERS, LINKS and COMMANDS):
    AC_CONFIG_COMMANDS(command:input,...) is no longer allowed.
    (#define header templates): The comment at the top of the generated
    header now includes the name(s) of the source file(s).
    
    Several unrelated small changes:
    
    * lib/autoconf/general.m4 (AC_CACHE_VAL): Be didactic, quote the first
    parameter to AC_DIAGNOSE.
    * lib/autoconf/status.m4 (AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS): Likewise.
    (_AC_LINK_FILES_CNT): Don't AU_DEFUN this; it causes confusing messages
    with autoupdate; use m4_define_default inside AU_DEFUNed AC_LINK_FILES.
    (AC_OUTPUT): In the compatibility code, use m4_ifvaln, to be consistent
    with AU::AC_OUTPUT.
    (AU::AC_OUTPUT): Don't double-quote $2 and $3, the compatibility code
    in AC_OUTPUT doesn't double-quote it either.
    * tests/tools.at (autoupdate): AU::AC_OUTPUT no longer double-quotes the
    parameters.

    Simplify the implementation of m4_require (a.k.a. AC_REQUIRE).
    Update the long comment explaining it.
    
    m4_require no longer writes an ``is required by'' line to the
    execution stack.  It contains only one bit of non-redundant
    information: that the macro was required, not called.  And even
    this bit is useless in most situations: have you ever met a macro
    which both calls and requires the same macro?
    
    * lib/m4sugar/m4sugar.m4 (_m4_defun_pro): Don't push a diversion...
    (_m4_defun_pro_outer): ... only via this macro, for the outermost
      macro.
    (_m4_defun_epi, _m4_defun_epi_outer): Complementarily.
    (m4_expansion_stack_pop): Remove the misplaced comment.
    (m4_require): Don't put the ``is required by'' line to the
      execution stack; slightly improve the out-of-a-defun error message.
    (_m4_divert_grow): New macro, counter for the temporary diversions.
    (_m4_require_call): Use it.
    * tests/m4sugar.at (m4_require): Expect output without the
      ``is required by'' messages.

    The test suite are sometimes assigning timings incorrectly.
    Reported by Paivio Pollari.
    Diagnosed by Nicolas Joly.
    * lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_CLEANUP): Rename AT_help as
    AT_help_all.
    Instead of making AT_help a sequence of assignments to grow
    $at_help_all, just make AT_help_all be the growing contents of
    $at_help_all, and make a single assignment in...
    (AT_INIT): here.
    (at_times_skip): Flip the meaning and rename as...
    (at_times_p): this.
    (AT_INIT): When summarizing the test that ran, remove
    $at_times_file after use, and check it is present before trying to
    use it.

    Version 2.57d.
    * bin/Makefile.am (edit): Handle '@configure_input@'.
    (autoconf, autoheader, autom4te, autoreconf, autoscan, autoupdate)
    (ifnames): chmod -w.
    * tests/wrapper.as (AUTOCONF, AUTOM4TE, ): Point to tests/
    executables, not bin/ executables!  Otherwise all the magic needed
    to find non installed files is turned off.  This caused a failure
    of test 40 and 41 that ran aclocal 1.8 which in turn ran autom4te
    as found in its environment (sent by tests/autoreconf): pointing
    to bin/autom4te that could not find its files.
    * tests/mktests.sh: Force the replacement of generated files, for
    the sake of "mv" program that are interactive when overwriting a
    -w file.
    * config/install-sh: Upgrade from CVS Automake.

    First stab at preserving warnings between calls to autom4te,
    including when the cache is used.
    There are still several issues: (i) there are too many runs of m4
    (one for include, one for warnings, and some more), (ii) warnings
    spreading on several lines are not handled gracefully, (iii) the
    code meant to have the call stack display for errors does not work
    (its handling should move from m4 to autom4te).
    * bin/autom4te.in Autom4te::Channels, Autom4te::ChannelDefs):
    Use them.
    (@preselect): Add m4_warn.
    ($exit_status): Remove, use $exit_code.
    ($help): Use Autom4te::ChannelDefs::usage.
    (&handle_m4): No longer define the m4_warnings.
    At each run, extract and report the warnings.
    Always cache the result, including if the exit status is on
    failure, since if nothing changes, we should result in the same
    failure, hence we can use the cache.
    * lib/m4sugar/m4sugar.m4 (m4_warning_ifelse, _m4_warning_ifelse)
    (_m4_warning_error_ifelse, __m4_warning_error_ifelse, _m4_warn):
    Remove.
    (m4_warn): Redefine as a do-nothing: it is its invocation that
    matters, as warnings are now reported via traces.
    * lib/autoconf/general.m4 (AC_DIAGNOSE): Don't make it a copy of
    the contents of m4_warn: make it _call_ m4_warn, so that tracing
    the latter reveals calls to the former.
    Adjust the tests.
    * tests/m4sugar.at (m4@&t@_warn): Use existing warning categories.

    (_AC_PROG_CXX_EXIT_DECLARATION):
    Remove `#include <stdlib.h>' from the list; we should never
    make confdefs.h include <stdlib.h> or <cstdlib>, because the
    resulting namespace pollution would cause other tests to fail.
    Configure scripts run with some older versions of g++ and HP's
    aCC would fail due to such an #include.  Problems reported by
    Matthew Mueller in <http://bugs.debian.org/120704> and by
    Keith Bostic in
    <http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf/2003-05/msg00063.html>.
    In the test, use the test declaration before including <stdlib.h>,
    as that's closer to how it'll be used.

    Overhaul Autotest's logging: generate separate log files
    in testsuite.dir/NNN/testsuite.log, and append them to
    testsuite.log instead of re-running the test verbosely.
    Adapt documentation.  Update NEWS to signal possible bad
    interactions between -x and experr.

    * lib/autoconf/autoheader.m4 (_AH_TEMPLATE_OLD, _AH_VERBATIM_OLD):
    Remove.
    We _have_ to stop using the old compatibility scheme that tried to
    avoid useless backslashes because Libtool 1.4.3 contains a
    AC_DEFINE([error_t], [int],
    [Define to a type to use for `error_t' if it is not
    otherwise available.])
    We _have_ to quote the single quote and backslashes with .  The
    old compatibility scheme saw that ` was backslashed, and therefore
    did not quote the single quote.  Hence before this patch, Autoconf
    was not compatible with Libtool.

    1003.1-2001's requirements for CDPATH.  Give a simpler workaround
    for the CDPATH problem.  Document PWD.
    (Limitations of Builtins): Document the problem that "cd $foo" and
    "ls $foo" may refer to different directories in shells conforming
    to POSIX 1003.1-2001.  Use PS1 rather than CDPATH for "unset"
    example, since the old example is now out of date.
    
    * lib/autoconf/general.m4 (_AC_INIT_SRCDIR): Reject FOO if "cd

    * doc/autoconf.texi (Programming in M4sh): Add AS_MKDIR_P.
    (Limitations of Usual Tools): Add mkdir section.
    
    * lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 (_AS_MKDIR_P_PREPARE): New macro.
    (AS_MKDIR_P): Require it.  Use mkdir -p if available, falling
    back on AS_DIRNAME to compute prefixes otherwise; this is
    roughly what mkinstalldirs does.  That way, we need not have
    our own filename disassembler.  The old disassembler did not
    work with Solaris 8 dtksh, which is ksh Version M-12/28/93d.
    
    * lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT, AT_CLEANUP):
    Create at_test_all by a series of assignments,
    not by a single assignment of a long string.  The latter causes ksh
    version 11/16/88g to silently misbehave on OpenServer 5.0.6a,
    presumably because of a buffer overrun.

    * lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): Don't be ridiculous: adjust
    AUTOTEST_PATH *after* it was set.
    Don't put `.' in the PATH: the user should be precise and `./' if
    needed.  In addition, given that the test suite does some `cd', if
    `.' is in the path, the `tested programs' sections will report
    programs found in the test suite's directory, while during the
    tests (performed in their own directory), these programs are no
    longer visible.  In other words, the results is confusing and
    useless.
    * tests/m4sh.at: Adjust: don't rely on `.' being in the PATH.

    This patch implements a `long double' suggestion by Oliver Kiddle.
    
    * lib/autoconf/c.m4 (AC_LANG_BOOL_COMPILE_TRY(C)): Make the array
    static, to catch errors if the value isn't known at compile-time
    and the compiler supports dynamic arrays.  Change its name from

    to create `$1' etc., therefore, the defining macro ``swallows''
    all the arguments meant to the defined macro.

Date:   Wed Oct 31 19:26:21 2001 +0000

    (Special Shell Variables): Autoconf now uses Sed rather than Awk for
    LINENO substitution, and some LINENO bugs have been fixed when using
    Sed.

commit 4c359a43491c37203e08f2350cff1043a87ca18b
Author: Paul Eggert <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
Date:   Wed Oct 31 19:23:37 2001 +0000

    (_AS_LINENO_PREPARE): Use Sed rather than Awk.  Fix the sed prepass to
    work even if there are multiple instances of $LINENO on the same line.
    Do not substitute for other variables like $LINENOT.  Do not check
    file dates; such a check is unreliable on sufficiently fast machines,
    and removing the check makes the code simpler and more reliable.
    Check for output and chmod failures.

    Fix bug reported by Paul Townsend on AIX 4.3.3.0 with CFLAGS=-O4
    or CFLAGS=-O5.  In that case, the linker has a relaxed view of

    when they don't exist.
    
    * lib/autoconf/headers.m4 (AC_HEADER_DIRENT): Use AC_SEARCH_LIBS,

    Pass `autoconf_dir' via options, not via invisible envvars.
    * lib/Autom4te/General.pm (&find_peer): Remove.
    * lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): `AUTOTEST_PATH=a:b' gives

    * tests/atlocal.in: Remove all the obscure envvar manipulations.
    We only need PERL.
    * tests/atspecific.m4, tests/tools.at: Passing --localdir is
    indeed related to running the test suite, while passing
    --autoconf-dir and others is related to running non installed
    Autoconf executables.  So don't do that, leave it to...

Author: Akim Demaille <akim@epita.fr>
Date:   Tue Aug 7 07:57:01 2001 +0000

    * lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): All the `at-*' are to be
    removed.
    (at-setup-line): Huh?  Be a variable `at_setup_line', not a file.
    No need to remove the files before and after the each test, before
    each test and at the end of the suite is enough.
    Display only the children `times', not the shell's.
    If the test failed or was skipped, at-times is not available.

    Always produce testsuite.log, including when there are no
    failures.  This helps getting information on skipped tests, and
    duration of the tests.  Err, implement the latter btw.
    * lib/autotest/general.m4 (AT_INIT): Set up fd 6 for the log.
    Dump information on the first run of each test.
    (AT_CLEANUP): Create `at-times' containing the duration of the
    test group.

    The use of `dumpstat' revealed that `len' was used although it
    should not.  m4_text_wrap was using it, but in the Autoconf world
    where it is legal.  Hence (i) test M4sh in its own world, not
    Autoconf's, and (ii), ahem, fix the bug :)
    * lib/autotest/general.m4: Be sure the set good quotes, as tracing
    does not like `' instead of [].
    (AT_INIT): Forbid `^_?AT_'.
    And don't output such tokens.
    * tests/Makefile.am (CLEANFILES): Add `script', `script.s4g',
    `script.as', and `autom4te.cache'.
    Remove `empty' and `macro' which are no longer used.
    * tests/atspecific.m4 (AT_CHECK_M4SUGAR, AT_CHECK_M4SH): New.
    * tests/m4sugar.at: Use it.
    * lib/m4sugar/m4sugar.m4: Use `m4_len' not `len'.

    Don't rely on M4sugar outputting the patterns in files, since we
    might process the output _without_ running m4, hence without these
    files.
    * lib/m4sugar/m4sugar.m4 (m4_init): No need for `m4_tmpdir'.
    * bin/autom4te.in (@Request::includes): Remove, unused.
    (@Request::source): Rename as...
    (@Request::input): this.
    (@preselect): Add `m4_pattern_forbid' and `m4_pattern_allow'.
    (&handle_output): Fetch the patterns from the traces.
    `$forbidden' and `$allowed' are constant: use m//o.
    (&handle_m4): M4sugar no longer wants `m4_tmpdir'.
    (m4_pattern_forbid, m4_pattern_allow): Adjust for tracing only.

Date:   Sat Aug 4 13:16:30 2001 +0000

    `autoconf && autoheader' is sped up.  Now, speed up `autoheader &&
    autoconf', i.e., in addition to caching traces, cache the output.
    * bin/autom4te.in (Request::cache): Rename as...
    (Request::id): this.
    ($cache, $icache, $tcache, $ocache): New.
    (&handle_m4): Save M4 output in the cache instead of $tmp.
    (&handle_output): Adjust.
    (&up_to_date_p): Check that the output cache is up to date too.
    (top level): Run `&handle_m4' iff force or the cache is invalid.
    Run `&handle_output' if the output cache is more recent.

    (&handle_output): CPP directives might have spaces after `#'.
    (&parse_args): The first file only can be frozen.

Date:   Sat Aug 4 13:14:39 2001 +0000

    Don't let autom4te compute the `include' traces several times:
    first check that the trace cache file is up to date, and then
    compare its timestamp with that of the output.
    * bin/autom4te.in, bin/autoupdate.in, bin/autoscan.in: Normalize
    the preamble.  Don't require 5.005 as Autom4te::General does it,
    and better yet (use `use', not `require'!).
    * lib/Autom4te/Struct.pm: Rename the last occurrences of
    Class::Struct as Autom4te::Struct.
    * lib/Autom4te/General.pm (File::stat): Use it.
    (&mtime): New, export it.
    * bin/autom4te.in: Use it.
    Declare `$req' is invalid if it is outdated.
    Don't declare it valid before saving it if something went wrong.

    Autom4te shall not encode Autoconf data, and preselecting traces
    must be proposed to the users.

    (&parse_args, &print_usage): -p, --preselect is a new option.
    (&up_to_date_p): Adjust.

    Mention C++ as well as C.  In the example, don't #ifdef F77_FUNC
    before using it, as that would push any errors to link-time rather
    than compile-time; note that the user can test this to invoke
    alternative behavior.

    Clean up cache documentation: Document --config-cache/-C option, and
    recommend instead of --cache-file.  Indent example AC_CACHE_VAL macros
    for clarity.  Add new "Cache Checkpointing" section for AC_CACHE_SAVE
    (and AC_CACHE_LOAD), so that the "Cache Files" section focuses solely
    on features visible to end-users (e.g. to better fit the cross
    references).  Various minor rewordings for clarity, felicity, and/or
    grammar.

    the debug scripts, this avoids having zillions of banners `Testing
    Blabla 2.13' (another means to avoid these banners is to have the
    test suite succeed :-).

    expected and oberved (stdout, stderr, exit status).
    Let `0' be the default for EXIT-STATUS.
    Support EXIT-STATUS == `ignore'.

    the last test run.

    Transform Autotest's body into a `for test; case $test'.
    As a known side effect, currently any code outside

    * m4sugar.m4: here.

    (_AC_SYS_LARGEFILE_TEST_INCLUDES): this.
    (AC_SYS_LARGEFILE_MACRO_VALUE): Use AC_LANG_PROGRAM instead of
    _AC_SYS_LARGEFILE_SOURCE, i.e., don't pass
    _AC_SYS_LARGEFILE_TEST_INCLUDES by default: this isn't desirable
    when checking for fseeko.

    Set AC_LANG_PREPROC_REQUIRE which replaces AC_REQUIRE_CPP.
    The main difference is that the former requires AC_LANG_COMPILER.
    * aclang (AC_LANG_PREPROC, AC_LANG_PREPROC(C), AC_LANG_PREPROC(C++))
    (AC_LANG_PREPROC(Fortran 77), AC_LANG_PREPROC_REQUIRE): New
    macros.  Issue a warning when looking for the Fortran 77
    preprocessor instead of an error.
    (AC_LANG_COMPILER): Check that it is run before the corresponding
    AC_LANG_PREPROC.
    (AC_PROG_C
    (AC_LANG_COMPILER_REQUIRE): Don't call directly
    AC_LANG_COMPILER(_AC_LANG), rather invoke AC_LANG_COMPILER so that
    the generic code in AC_LANG_COMPILER is run.
    (AC_REQUIRE_CPP): Use AC_LANG_PREPROC_REQUIRE.
    (AC_PROG_CC, AC_PROG_CXX): Don't require being run before the
    corresponding AC_LANG_PREPROC: AC_LANG_COMPILER does it.

    (AC_C_PROTOTYPES): Likewise.
    (AC_C_STRINGIZE): Yeeks!  The body of AC_CACHE_CHECK was not
    quoted.  Use @%:@ do assist Emacs.
    For some reason (don't ask), this revamping revealed that
    AC_PROG_CC_STDC, because of the `break', does not clean its tmp
    files.
    * aclang.m4 (AC_PROG_CC_STDC): Extract the creation of conftest.c
    out of AC_COMPILE_IFELSE.
    Be sure to clean the tmp files.

    	Readability And Greater Understanding Stands 4 M4sugar
    name coined by Lars J. Aas.

    `AC_PREREQ'.
    * tests/tools.m4: Globally, don't use `../' to invoke the tested
    tools, since the PATH is properly set, and in most cases it
    obfuscates the test code.

    In order to check that all the CPP symbols which are AC_DEFINE'd
    are properly templated, autoheader traces
    AC_DEFINE/AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED.  Only literals can be traced, and
    actually tracing non literals produces invalid autoheader input.
    Hence, provide a means to trace calls to
    AC_DEFINE/AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED with literals.
    * acgeneral.m4 (AC_DEFINE_TRACE, AC_DEFINE_TRACE_LITERAL): New
    macros.
    (AC_DEFINE, AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED): Use AC_DEFINE_TRACE.
    * autoheader.sh: Trace AC_DEFINE_TRACE_LITERAL, not
    AC_DEFINE/AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED.

    * aclang.m4 (_AC_PROG_CC_G): Use the _AC_COMPILE_IFELSE macro
    instead of reinventing the wheel. This also takes care of a bug
    where the "-g" option was accepted if the compiler silently exits
    with status unequal to 0.
    (_AC_PROG_CXX_G): Likewise.
    (AC_PROG_CC): As _AC_PROG_CC_G depends on $ac_objext and

    front of _AC_PROG_CC_G.

Date:   Wed Oct 18 12:42:20 2000 +0000

    * tests/atgeneral.m4 (AT_INIT): Avoid foo="`bar`", foo=`bar` is
    enough.
    Use grep to check the presence of a string in a stream.
    * m4/atconfig.m4: Quote.

Author: Akim Demaille <akim@epita.fr>
Date:   Tue Oct 17 16:34:10 2000 +0000

    * acgeneral.m4 (AC_CHECK_TOOL): As AC_CHECK_PROG first tests the
    value of the VARIABLE argument when looking for executables, we
    need to set it to the correct value from AC_CHECK_TOOL when not
    just passing on the incoming VARIABLE directly.
    (AC_CHECK_TOOLS, AC_PATH_TOOL): Likewise.

    it includes another AU defined macro.

    The test suite fails on some hosts because for instance
      AC_INIT
      AC_CHECK_FUNC(exit)
    will not look for a compiler, it will just use `cc'.
    Macros that need a compiler should require one.

    * acgeneral.m4 (_AC_TRY_CPP): New macro. It runs the preprocessor
    and checks whether it produces errors or warnings. Don't put grep
    output into a variable, use another grep instead.
    (AC_TRY_CPP): Use _AC_TRY_CPP. Copy conftest.err to config.log
    if the case of an error.
    * aclang.m4 (AC_LANG(C), AC_LANG(C++), AC_LANG(Fortran 77)):
    define AC_LANG_ABBREV to the short language name.
    (_AC_PROG_CPP_WORKS): New macro. It checks whether the current
    preprocessor can be used to check for existance of headers.
    Most code taken from ...
    (AC_PROG_CPP): ... here. Use _AC_PROG_CPP_WORKS. Use shell
    "for" to find working CPP. Use AC_LANG_PUSH(C) and AC_LANG_POP -
    it's a macro for C only.
    (AC_PROG_CXXCPP): Rewritten using _AC_PROG_CPP_WORKS.

    Recommend Automake as the source of ansi2knr.
    (Autoconf Language, Quotation and Nested Macros): English fixes.
    (Quotation and Nested Macros): Unclear example replaced with

    AM_FUNC_MKTIME, AM_FUNC_OBSTACK, AM_FUNC_STRTOD): Deactivate

    * autoconf.sh (finalize.awk): New subtool, eved from the previous
    literal AWK program that performed the `oline' and quadrigraphs
    substitution.
    Fix its `oline' computation which was dead wrong when there are
    empty lines (i.e., always).
    Enhance it in order to look for and report unexpanded macro.
    Don't let it pretend there are bugs in Autoconf (c:, the test
    suite makes this scenario pretty unlikely as opposed to an actual
    user bug.
    Catch `m4_' too.
    Remove the shell snippet which used to do this.

    quotes (inside the macro itself, and where it is called).
    When you do this, Autoconf, hm, works better.

Author: Akim Demaille <akim@epita.fr>
Date:   Mon Jul 10 10:23:08 2000 +0000

    Set autoconf's default warnings to `syntax'.
    
    In fact, honor the most recent specification in the concatenation
    of `syntax',$WARNINGS,<options> in that order.
    Implement support for `none' and `noCATEGORY' so that the options
    may override the previous choices.
    Suggested by Didier Verna.
    
    * acgeneral.m4 (_AC_WARNING_IFELSE): New macro.
    (AC_WARNING_IFELSE): Use this macro to implement the new specs.
    (AC_WARNING): The empty category must not be used, default to
    `syntax'.

    * autoconf.sh: Adjust.
    Use `optarg' to fetch the arguments of options.
    Fix a bug in the handling of `--trace='.

    it shouldn't have.

    AC_REVISION must not AC_REQUIRE AC_INIT, it leaves the diversions
    in a messy state.  Don't even try to emulate AC_REQUIRE: just
    introduce a diversion just for AC_REVISION, and let the magic

    Fixes Autoconf PR/134, from Raja R Harinath.
    
    * acgeneral.m4 (_AC_DIVERT(REVISION)): New diversion.
    (AC_REVISION): Don't require AC_INIT, dump in your diversion.

    (AC_INIT): be more uniform.

    compiler needs it, it is likely to be required when linking C/C++
    with Fortran.
    <-YP,*>: Fix the list of arguments to loop on.
    Don't mess with the user variable name space.
    <ac_ld_run_path>: Prepend LD_RUN_PATH directories with -R only
    when running Solaris (without this, link errors occur).

    Re-enable the old behavior of --host and --build.
    
    * acgeneral.m4 (build_alias): Set to host_alias if --build is not

commit 12e3a8ea6e6a8b8c4f70db8b9bafca55c813e3ff
Author: Akim Demaille <akim@epita.fr>
Date:   Mon Jun 26 09:06:02 2000 +0000

    The current implementation of AC_REQUIRE fails on
    
    | AC_DEFUN([TEST1],  [REQUIRE([TEST2a])REQUIRE([TEST2b])])
    | AC_DEFUN([TEST2a], [])
    | AC_DEFUN([TEST2b], [REQUIRE([TEST3])])
    | AC_DEFUN([TEST3],  [REQUIRE([TEST2a])])
    |
    | AC_INIT
    | TEST1
    
    because it produces TEST3; TEST2a; TEST2b; TEST1.
    Fix this bug, implement the solution provided by Axel Thimm,
    and test AC_REQUIRE.
    
    * acgeneral.m4: Document this implementation.
    (_AC_DEFUN_PRO, _AC_DEFUN_EPI, AC_REQUIRE): Be sure that macros
    are emitted in the same order as they are expanded.
    (AC_REQUIRE): Forbid being calling out of an AC_DEFUN'd	macro (in
    particular the top level).
    * tests/base.m4 (AC_REQUIRE): New test.

    A macro which is not defined with AC_DEFUN should not be
    AC_REQUIRE'd, since it doesn't AC_PROVIDE itself.
    
    * acgeneral.m4 (AC_REQUIRE): Issue a warning when after expansion,
    the macro is not AC_PROVIDE'd.

    _AC_INIT_PREPARE, _AC_CANONICAL_SPLIT, _AC_CHECK_TYPE_NEW,
    _AC_CHECK_TYPE_OLD): Define via `define' instead of `AC_DEFUN':
    they are not related to AC_REQUIRE in any way.
    * acspecific.m4 (AC_PROG_ECHO, _AC_DECL_YYTEXT, _AC_PATH_X_XMKMF,
    _AC_PATH_X_DIRECT): Define via `define' instead of `AC_DEFUN'.

    * acgeneral.m4 (AC_CHECK_TOOL): Use two variables in order to
    avoid cache variable conflicts between AC_CHECK_PROG invocations.
    (AC_PATH_TOOL): Fix same bugs as in 6/9/00 fixes to AC_CHECK_TOOL.
    Pass correct arguments to AC_CHECK_PATH (different from
    AC_CHECK_PROG).  Use AC_CHECK_PATH cache variable, not
    AC_CHECK_PROG var, and use two variables for two invocations as
    above.  Quote AC_CHECK_* args.

    * acgeneral.m4 (AC_CHECK_TOOL): Even if VALUE-IF-NOT-FOUND is not
    specified, we should still check whether PROG-TO-CHECK-FOR
    actually works before returning it when the prefixed program is
    not found. Also, fixed a bug where it failed to pass the PATH

    Thanks to --program-transform-name, `autoconf' might be install as
    `yo-man-i-am-the-all-mighty-AVt0c0nF-eh-eh'.  But when
    `yo-man-i-am-the-all-mighty-AVt0h3Ad3R-eh-eh' and the other tools
    want to trace, they might stupidly invoke the program named
    `autoconf' instead.  Pfff, stupid scripts :)
    
    * Makefile.am (editsh): Transfer the names of the install
    `autoconf' and `autoheader'.
    * autoconf.sh: Add a missing period at the end of the comment
    # Parse command line
    Make sure to have a ChangeLog much longer than the patch.
    * autoheader.sh: Use the right `autoconf'.
    * autoupdate.sh: Likewise.

Date:   Fri May 26 17:27:24 2000 +0000

    Currently, AC_PROG_LN_S incorrectly reports yes with DJGPP. This
    is because the DJGPP `ln' emulates soft links for executables by
    generating a stub that in turn calls the real program.  This
    feature also works with nonexistent files like in the Unix
    spec. So `ln -s X conftestdata' will generate `conftestdata.exe'
    which will attempt to call 'X.exe'. But this feature only works
    for executables.  Fix it.
    
    * acspecific.m4 (AC_PROG_LN_S): Create a sample file and use it to
    test `ln -s'.

    The options --build etc. used to set `$build'.  *If*
    AC_CANONICAL_SYSTEM was run, then the value of `$build' given by
    the user was saved into `$build_alias', and `$build' was
    normalized using `config.sub'.
    
    Now, let `--build' set `$build_alias' so that scripts with or
    without `AC_CANONICAL_BUILD' have the same semantics.  This allows
    to use `AC_CHECK_TOOL' without requiring `config.guess' and
    `config.sub' (which was bizarre anyway).
    
    * acgeneral.m4 (_AC_INIT_PARSE_ARGS): --build, --host and --target
    set `build_alias' etc.
    After the option handling, set host to $host_alias etc. for

    (AC_CANONICALIZE): Mutate into...
    (_AC_CANONICAL_SPLIT): this, which does not canonicalize, it just
    computes `$foo_os' etc.
    (_AC_CANONICAL_THING): Remove, too confusing.
    (AC_CANONICAL_BUILD): Adjust.
    Do not assign any value to `build_alias', just compute `build', and
    `build_{cpy, vendor, os}'.
    (AC_CANONICAL_HOST, AC_CANONICAL_TARGET): Likewise.
    (AC_CHECK_TOOL_PREFIX): Fire your rule when `$host_alias' is

    * autoupdate.sh: Complete rewrite.  See that file for a detailed

    `autoconf --trace' and auxiliary files.
    No longer use `autoupdate.m4', remove the dependencies.

    * doc/autoconf.texi (Invoking autoupdate): Humanoupdate.
    * autoupdate.m4: Delete.

    output with the right quotation (yeah!).
    Pass `-m $top_srcdir': autoupdate want the `.m4' files, not the
    frozen files.

    (distpkgdataDATA): here, so that all the `.m4' files are in the
    source hierarchy, not split across src and build.
    * acversion.m4.in: Update to today's standards.

    mawk suffers a severe performance loss when using `sub' with a

    mawk '{ sub (/foo/, foo++) }'                  -> 14s.
    mawk '{ if ($0 ~ /foo/) sub (/foo/, foo++) }'  -> 0.03s.
    mawk '{ sub (/foo/, foo) }'                    -> 0.03s.

Author: Akim Demaille <akim@epita.fr>
Date:   Tue Mar 21 12:33:37 2000 +0000

    Fix a bug: some macros (e.g., AC_REVISION, AC_COPYRIGHT etc.) can
    be used before AC_INIT, but they do require it.  But then, the
    argument of the explicit AC_INIT call is lost.
    
    * acgeneral.m4 (AC_CONFIG_SRCDIR): New macro.
    (_AC_INIT_SRCDIR): Adjust.
    (_AC_INIT): Pass your argument to AC_CONFIG_SRCDIR.

commit 2200cf61c96b13426c6a8498b11a5b5e48386b62
Author: Akim Demaille <akim@epita.fr>
Date:   Tue Mar 21 12:15:54 2000 +0000

    Start the language support overhaul: Introduce AC_LANG().
    
    * acgeneral.m4 (AC_LANG): Renamed as _AC_LANG_CURRENT.
    (AC_LANG, AC_LANG(C), AC_LANG(C++), AC_LANG(FORTRAN77)): New
    macros.
    (AC_LANG_C, AC_LANG_CPLUSPLUS, AC_LANG_FORTRAN): AU_DEFUN'ed.

    AC_LANG_RESTORE.

Date:   Tue Mar 21 12:09:31 2000 +0000

    Speed ups.
    
    * libm4.m4 (m4_append, m4_list_append): Use m4_define, not define.
    On my machine the former implementation takes 4mn 40s to run the
    test suite.  Using m4_define leads to 4mn 15s.
    * acgeneral.m4 (_AC_SUBST): Use AC_EXPAND_ONCE (which uses
    m4_define, not define).  4mn.
    (_AC_DIVERT): Don't use m4_case.  Starting from those 4mn, if you
    just move NORMAL* first in m4_case, the test suite is run in 3mn.
    If instead of using m4, you use an `associative array' plus a
    wrapper (current implementation), it falls to 2mn.

Author: Akim Demaille <akim@epita.fr>
Date:   Tue Mar 21 12:06:30 2000 +0000

    * autoconf.sh (task trace): Pipe the output of the first m4 into
    the second one, instead of saving to a tmp file, so that we can
    trace endless configure.in expansion.

    (AC_SYS_LONG_FILE_NAMES): Don't test for existence
    of $ac_xdir.  Not only is `test -e' not portable, but the test isn't
    necessary at all;  the following mkdir ends up accomplishing the
    same goal.  Suggestion from Alexandre Oliva.

    Don't rely on RS = "0" to swallow the whole input as a single
    record, this is not portable: mawk and nawk understand it as RS =
    "".  gawk understands it as expected.

    (translate_awk::body): Move to the END.
    Instead, accumulate the input in `request'.

    Use a single tool to reformat the raw `configure' script output by
    m4.
    Suggested by Paul Eggert.
    
    * autoconf.sh: Stop playing with 2 seds and an AWK to finalize
    `configure', a single AWK program is enough.

    In Autoconf 2.13, although AC_OUTPUT_COMMANDS did double quote its
    arguments, AC_OUTPUT arguments 2 and 3 were not!  Currently,

    AC_OUTPUT.

    Handle the NLS envvars, and IFS.
    (_AC_INIT_PREPARE): Use it, no longer set the NLS envvars.

    * acgeneral.m4 (AC_TRY_CPP, AC_EGREP_CPP, AC_TRY_COMPILE,
    AC_TRY_LINK, AC_TRY_RUN_NATIVE): Simplify the removal of the
    contest files: don't remove them before running the actions, just
    remove them at the end of the macro.

    * acspecific.m4 (AC_FUNC_SELECT_ARGTYPES): Use a single cache
    variable instead of three.
    Use AC_CACHE_CHECK.
    Shorten the name of the var loops, they are no longer cached.
    Include sys/types.h unconditionally.
    `select' returns an int, fixes Autoconf/46.
    Don't display parens in the user messages.

    (AC_REVISION): Require AC_INIT, not _AC_INIT_BINSH.
    (AC_INIT): Do what _AC_INIT_BINSH used to.
    Don't require _AC_INIT_VERSION, just call it.
    Rename as _AC_INIT.
    (AC_INIT): New macro, single expansion wrapper around _AC_INIT.
    (_AC_COPYRIGHT_SEPARATOR): New.
    (AC_COPYRIGHT): Use it.

Date:   Tue Mar 14 08:27:19 2000 +0000

    * acgeneral.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_CONFIG_STATUS): When there were no
    CONFIG_FILES, we had to expand _AC_OUTPUT_FILES into the KILL
    diversion, because it is AC_OUTPUT_FILES which undiverted the
    AC_SUBST sed script at its proper place, otherwise it would have
    been undiverted at the end of `configure', leading to an sh syntax
    error.
    Now that we no longer use a diversion, we don't need to call
    AC_OUTPUT_FILES if useless.
    (AC_OUTPUT_FILES): Rename as _AC_OUTPUT_FILES.
    (AC_OUTPUT_LINKS): Rename as _AC_OUTPUT_LINKS.

    AC_ARG_PROGRAM must not be expanded twice, which is likely since
    Automake calls it, and usually users do too.  If it happens,
    `--program-prefix=g' actually prepend two (or more) `g'.
    
    * acgeneral.m4 (AC_DEFUN_ONCE): New macro.
    (AC_ARG_PROGRAM): AC_DEFUNed_ONCE.  Or is it AC_DEFUN_ONCE'd? :).
    No longer AC_EXPAND_ONCE the help string, the macro itself is
    expanded at most once.
    Rename the here-doc tag EOF_SED as EOF.

    failed experiment.

    Simplify the diversions naming system.
    Suggested by Alexandre Oliva and Lars J. Aas
    
    * libm4.m4 (ifndef): New macro.
    * acgeneral.m4 (AC_DIVERT): New macro, maps a diversion name to
    its value.  The diversions now have a short name, e.g., `NOTICE',
    instead of the former macros which had long names, e.g.,
    `AC_DIVERSION_NOTICE'.
    (AC_DIVERT_PUSH): Adjust.
    (AC_DIVERT_POP): Use ifndef.
    (AC_DIVERSION_CURRENT): Rename as `AC_DIVERT_DIVERSION' to stay
    within the `AC_DIVERT' name domain.
    Adjust all callers.
    * acspecific.m4: Adjust all callers.

    (translate_awk::error): New function.
    (translate_awk::main action): Implement support for ${sep}@ and
    ${sep}*.  Use trans() and error().
    (translate_awk): Don't put space before user functions call, it is
    not portable.
    Remove trailing `;', this is not C :).
    (task trace): Quote `$traces' when you eval it, to protect the
    white spaces.
    Propagate `translate_awk' failures to `autoconf.sh'.
    Translate the quadrigraphs.

    More uniform style is scripts.
    
    * autoheader.sh: s/-eq/=/.
    Uniform ordering of variable initializations, option handling.
    Don't use quotes where useless (foo=$1, not foo="$1").
    Propagate `run_m4' and `run_m4f'.
    Use `$0' in --help.
    * autoconf.sh: Likewise.
    * autoreconf.sh: Likewise.
    * autoupdate.sh: Likewise.
    * ifnames.sh: Likewise.

    (task trace): Instead of decoding `m4 --trace' with sed, decode it

    Multiple `-e' to egrep are not portable.  On IRIX 6.5 and Solaris
    2.5.1 only the last one is honored:
      > echo "foonbar" | egrep -e 'foo' -e 'bar'
      bar
      > echo "foonbar" | egrep -e 'bar' -e 'foo'
      foo
    Reported by Nicolas Joly.
    An alternative would have to use `sed', unfortunately alternation
    is not portable.
    
    * tests/actest.m4 (join): New macro.
    (AC_ENV_SAVE): Join the egrep patterns into a single big one.
    * tests/Makefile.am (EGREP_EXCLUDE): Rename as FILTER_MACROS.
    Join the egrep patterns into a single big one.

    * acspecific.m4 (AC_SYS_RESTARTABLE_SYSCALLS): Added some missing
    headers if they exist (needed for some missing prototypes) and
    corrects the signal handler prototype/definition.  The signal
    handler prototype is now prepended with an `extern "C"' for C++
    compilers since some platforms explicitly require an `extern "C"'
    signal handler.

    testsuite rebuilt each time an ac*.m4 file changes.  It is enough
    to build it for each `make check'.

    Support absolute DOS-style paths.
    
    Any character before the colon is accepted because network drives
    can be assigned characters outside the [a-zA-Z] range. DOS-style
    relative paths (?:foo/bar) are also considered absolute for
    Autoconf's purposes since the path '../?:foo/bar' is invalid.

    Fix the `missing dummy.in' reported by the test suite.
    Reported by Erez Zadok.
    
    * tests/torture.m4 (config.status under extreme conditions):
    Reorganized.  Because files required by this test were created
    outside the pair AT_SETUP/AT_CLEANUP, when the test fails and
    autotest extracts this test, the `debug' script does not contain
    the files it needs.  Now AT_SETUP/AT_CLEANUP encloses the full
    auto contained section.

    Interrupting autoheader left temp files.
    From Jim Meyering.

    Install the `trap' before creating the first tmp file.

    * acgeneral.m4 (AC_OUTPUT_MAKE_DEFS): This is a routine of
    `configure', not `config.status', hence use `conftest' for tmp
    files, not `$ac_cs_root'.
    Removed forgotten developer comment.
    Double quoting the whole body is nicer than just the part that
    needs to be.

    Changequote-busters!
    From Dan Ackroyd.
    
    * acgeneral.m4 (AC_INIT_PARSE_ARGS, AC_INIT_PREPARE,
    AC_CACHE_SAVE, AC_PREFIX_PROGRAM, AC_OUTPUT,
    _AC_OUTPUT_CONFIG_STATUS, AC_OUTPUT_MAKE_DEFS, AC_OUTPUT_FILES,
    _AC_OUTPUT_HEADERS, AC_OUTPUT_LINKS, AC_OUTPUT_SUBDIRS): Quit
    playing with changequotes, @BKL@ and Co.!  Just quote properly.

commit 08de8c9f931365ac8a2dbcdf988dceee7c093753
Author: Akim Demaille <akim@epita.fr>
Date:   Thu Feb 10 10:38:59 2000 +0000

    Honor properly the `#define' config.h.in templates.
    Test it.
    
    * acgeneral.m4 (AC_OUTPUT_HEADERS): Renamed as...
    (_AC_OUTPUT_HEADERS): this.  All callers changed.
    Don't mess with changequote, just quote properly.
    Bug 1.  Because of the `#' in `ac_dA', the quotes <<>> were not
    removed, and therefore the sed script contained `<<define>>'
    instead of `define'.  Now that the block is properly quoted, there
    is no need to quote `define'.
    Bug 2.  Once a `#define' substitution performed, we were branching
    to the top of the sed script (`t top').  This resulted in an
    endless substitution of `#define foo 1' to `#define foo 1'.
    Branching is not enough: you also have to fetch the next input
    line, i.e., use `t' instead of `t t' in ac_dD, and don't output
    `: top' in `config.defines'.
    Though it was correct for `#undef' templates, just apply the same
    transformation to `ac_uD' and `config.undefs'.
    Bug 3.  Don't try to preserve what was behind the value in the
    template, since on
    	#define NAME "bar baz"
    it leads to
    	#define NAME 1 baz"
    Now `ac_dB' catches everything behind the NAME (making sure there
    is at least a space) and `ac_dC' only outputs a space.
    * tests/torture.m4: Check that various forms of `#define' header
    templates are properly handled.

Date:   Thu Feb 10 10:37:03 2000 +0000

    Avoid calling `rm' without arguments.
    
    * acgeneral.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_CONFIG_STATUS): It is smarter to use a
    quoted here doc to output the section providing defaults for
    CONFIG_*.
    Don't rm the CONFIG_FILES here but in..
    (AC_OUTPUT_FILES) [test -n "$CONFIG_FILES"]: here.
    Hm, actually, no, just don't remove them at all, let the newly
    created files replace the old ones, exactly as in
    AC_OUTPUT_HEADERS.
    From Graham Jenkins.

    * acgeneral.m4 (_AC_OUTPUT_CONFIG_STATUS): Don't
      : ${FOO="$foo"}
    but
      : ${FOO=$foo}
    Since Ultrix will also assign the quotes to FOO.

    The AU-glue code for AC_LINK_FILES was not fully compatible: in
      AC_LINK_FILES($from, $to)
    `$from' and `$to' can be lists, hence `AC_CONFIG_LINKS($to:$from)'
    is wrong.
    Reported by H.J. Lu.

    * acgeneral.m4 (AC_INIT_PARSE_ARGS, getopt loop): Always define
    ac_optarg as the rhs of the first `=', not only on `-.*=', so that
    `configure var=val' defines ac_optarg=val.
    Improve the robustness to shell special characters:
     - Use grep when checking that shell variable names are valid.
     - Quote the quotes in ac_optarg before `eval var='$ac_optarg''.

    AC_CONFIG_FILES): Use it, and also temporarily divert to -1
    instead of spamming dnl everywhere.
    (AC_OUTPUT_CONFIG_STATUS): Make sure to output the INIT-CMDS
    before the other sections, it'd be a pity to initialize after the
    use :).
    
    * doc/autoconf.texi (Configuration Actions): New section,
    documenting the common behavior of AC_CONFIG_FILES,
    AC_CONFIG_HEADERS, macro AC_CONFIG_COMMANDS, and AC_CONFIG_LINKS.

    Improve support of name spaces in libm4.  Put the m4 builtins
    in the `libm4' name space.
    
    * libm4 (m4_changequote, m4_define, m4_defn, m4_dnl, m4_indir,
    m4_undefine): Private copies in the global name space.  Used by
    the name space mechanisms.
    (m4_namespace_register): New macro.
    (m4_namespace_define): Use it.
    (builtin, changequote, defn, dnl, esyscmd, ifdef, ifelse, indir,
    patsubst, popdef, pushdef, regexp, undefine, syscmd, sysval): Put
    in the `libm4' name space.
    (m4_disable, m4_enable): Use the private m4_indir, otherwise once
    `libm4' closed, there is no `indir' available, and therefore no
    means to reopen a name space.

    Output really nothing if AC_INIT was not given.  Unconditional
    output can be problematic with autoupdate.
    
    * acgeneral.m4 (AC_INIT_NOTICE): Output ac_includes_default.
    (Default includes section): No longer dump ac_includes_default in
    AC_DIVERSION_INIT.

    * libm4.m4 (m4_namespace_define): Fix a bug: `m4_namespace'
    instead of `$1'.
    Simplify some excess in quoting.
    Use NAMESPACE::MACRONAME instead of `m4_defn(NAMESPACE,
    MACRONAME)'.

    Adapt autoheader to use libm4's namespaces.
    
    * autoheader.m4 (AH_HOOK): Removed.
    (AH_DEFUN): Define in the `autoheader' name space.
    Use only AH_DEFUN to define macros in this file.
    (epilogue): No longer run the `AH_HOOKS', enter the `autoheader'
    name space.

    Clean up a bit the user interface.
    
    * autoconf.sh: Give your name while reporting errors.
    Don't spit --help for errors on arguments.
    * autoreconf.sh: Likewise.
    * autoheader.sh: Likewise.
    More temporary files that one can browse when debugging.
    Don't ${var}, just $var.
    Don't dump --help when the arguments are invalid.
    (config_h): Use the empty value instead of `undefined' to check
    that it is defined.
    * acspecific.m4: Formatting changes.

    Introduce name spaces in libm4.
    
    * libm4.m4 (m4_namespace_push, m4_namespace_pop,
    m4_namespace_define, define, m4_disable, m4_enable, m4_rename):
    New macros.
    (_m4_foreach, _m4_for, m4_wrap): Use m4_define for temporaries.
    (m4_split): Don't mess with the quotes.
    
    * acgeneral.m4 (AC_OUTPUT_MAKE_DEFS, AC_OUTPUT_HEADERS): Quote
    `define'.

    * doc/autoconf.texi (Introduction): m4 1.4 is now required.
    (Invoking autoconf): A better help on --trace.
    (Defining Symbols): Advocate a proper use of the quotes in m4
    code, including if the quotes are sometimes useless.  It is bad,
    very bad not to quote properly, so quote all the examples
    properly.
    (Cache Files): Use a unary call to define, instead of an empty
    $2.
    (Using System Type): Watch out TeX wrapping.
    (Pretty Help Strings): Don't give too long a snippet of --help.
    Promote the coding style of Autoconf.  Quote properly.

Date:   Tue Feb 8 11:06:23 2000 +0000

    * acgeneral.m4 (AC_PRO): Use AC_PROVIDE instead of defining
    yourself.  This allows to see everything that is AC_PROVIDEd via
    autoconf --trace.
    (AC_SPECIALIZE): define'd, not AC_DEFUN'd.
    (AC_PROVIDE): Use define with a single arg, instead of an empty $2.

    * acgeneral.m4 (ac_includes_default): Don't use simple quotes, but
    doubles quotes if you want to use -continuation lines: this is
    not recognized by MIPS' sh.

    Use AC_LANG_CASE instead of ifelse (AC_LANG, ...).

    * acspecific.m4 (AC_DECL_SYS_SIGLIST, AC_FUNC_MMAP,
    AC_FUNC_SETPGRP, AC_FUNC_VFORK, AC_FUNC_SELECT_ARGTYPES): Use #if,
    not #ifdef and #ifndef, indent CPP directives.

    It seems quite delicate to have AC_INCLUDES_DEFAULT insert the
    default headers in the INIT section of configure: the reason is
    that AC_INCLUDES_DEFAULT is called unquoted, and this results in
    an un expected behavior.  Thanks to Roman V. Shaposhnick for the
    details.
    
    The current implementation is not satisfying: the default headers
    are defined in the INIT section even if they are not used.
    
    * acgeneral.m4 (Prologue of AC_INCLUDES_DEFAULTS): Dump the
    definition of ac_includes_default in the INIT section of
    configure.
    (AC_INCLUDES_DEFAULTS): Use it.

    Renamed f77_link_output as ac_link_output.

    Run the `syntax' test on acgeneral macros too.
    Fix the bugs discovered.
    
    * acgeneral.m4 (AC_CANONICAL_THING): Quote the
    AC_REQUIRE([AC_CANONICAL_HOST]).  Bug triggered by the use of
    AC_CANONICAL_BUILD alone in configure.in.  Also, quote the
    arguments of macros (eg, ifelse([$1]...), not ifelse($1...)).
    (m4_case): New macro.
    (AC_LINKER_OPTION): Don't clash with user's name space
    (s/i/ac_link_opt).
    (AC_LIST_MEMBER_OF).  You mean AC_FATAL, not AC_MSG_ERROR.
    Quote properly the argument.
    dnl out the empty lines that result from m4 pure code.
    Don't pollute the user name space.
    Use AC_SHELL_IFELSE.
    (AC_F77_NAME_MANGLING): Don't use `test -o'.  There are still
    name space problems.
    * tests/Makefile.am (macros.m4): Also fetch the macros from
    acgeneral.m4.

    optional $2: exit status.

Author: Akim Demaille <akim@epita.fr>
Date:   Fri Feb 4 10:23:15 2000 +0000

    Check that the AC_DEFINEs from acspecific.m4 do have a template.
    Fix the discovered bugs.
    
    * tests/atgeneral.m4 (AT_CHECK): Don't just exit 1 when you want
    to propagate the failure of a test: exit with the same exit
    status, at least to preserve 77 (=ignore).
    * tests/syntax.m4 (TEST_MACRO): Run also autoheader.  Don't run
    this test on all the macros, some just cannot run without
    arguments.
    * acgeneral.m4 (AC_OUTPUT_CONFIG_STATUS): In the if egrep/fi for
    #define templates, add a `:' to prevent syntax errors in
    config.status when there are no AC_DEFINE performed.
    * autoheader.m4 (AH_TEMPLATE): Don't use _AC_SH_QUOTE here, use it
    in...
    (AH_VERBATIM): here.  Now AH_C_UNSIGNED_CHAR is no longer failing
    (formerly it would produce a non backslashed backquote, which
    made sh choke).

    Introduce a means to distinguish failures of `configure' due to
    extern software (so that the test suite doesn't fail on them).
    
    * acgeneral.m4 (AC_MSG_ERROR, AC_MSG_ERROR_UNQUOTED): Allow an
    optional $2: exit status.
    * doc/autoconf.texi: Document.
    * acspecific.m4 (AC_PROG_CC_WORKS, PROG_CXX_WORKS,
    AC_PROG_F77_WORKS): Exit 77 if the compiler does not work.

    (AC_LINKER_OPTION): Use AC_LANG_CASE.

    	A test suite will be introduced which tries to run all the
    	specific macros, but hasbeen'd macro make configure die with bad
    	exit status.  So we wish to distinguish live macros from defunct
    	macros at the moment they are AC_DEFUN'd, not in their body.  Hm,
    	defunct, defunct... Hey!  That's a good name!
    
    	* acgeneral.m4 (AC_DEFUNCT): New macro, comparable to AC_DEFUN,
    	but for macros which are no longer defined.  Replaces AC_HASBEEN.
    	(AC_HASBEEN): Defunct.  Well, removed in fact.
    	(AC_HAVE_LIBRARY): Don't use AC_DEFUN and AC_HASBEEN, just
    	AC_DEFUNCT.
    	* acspecific.m4 (AC_UNISTD_H, AC_USG, AC_MEMORY_H, AC_DIR_HEADER,
    	AC_INT_16_BITS, AC_LONG_64_BITS): Likewise.
    	(AC_XENIX_DIR): It was defunct even before I declared it was: was
    	depending upon AC_DIR_HEADER which is defunct.  So AC_DEFUNCT'ed
    	now.
    	(AC_DYNIX_SEQ, AC_IRIX_SUN, AC_SCO_INTL): While we're here, you
    	too are defunct now.
    	* autoconf.texi (Obsolete Macros): Replace the documentation of
    	AC_HASBEEN with that of AC_DEFUNCT.

    	from library files to the local dir so that the packages depends
    	only on local extensions.  Check that the user includes exactly

    	Require GNU m4 1.4 (well 1.3 in fact).
    
    	Because we are ready to handle the case where there are no frozen
    	files, we *have* to pass a -I, which is dangerous in conjunction
    	with the silent including of `aclocal.m4': you may include things
    	that were not expected.  Since anyway handling pre 1.3 complicates
    	the task, just require an m4 which supports reloading of frozen
    	files.
    
    	* acspecific.m4 (AC_PROG_GNU_M4): Check for --reload.
    	* autoconf.sh: Likewise
    	* autoheader.sh: Likewise.

    	* acgeneral.m4 (m4_errprint, m4_warn, m4_fatal): New macros,
    	variations around errprint.
    	(m4_include_unique): New macro which registers what are the files
    	already included, and warns if some are included several times.
    	(m4_include, m4_sinclude): New macro, using m4_include_unique.
    	(AC_INCLUDE): Is now just a wrapper of m4_include.

    1999-11-01  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>
    
    	Fix a bit of the brokenness of AC_CHECK_TYPE.
    
    	* acgeneral.m4 (AC_CHECK_TYPE_INTERNAL): New macro, inspired from
     	the former AC_CHECK_TYPE.  This macro is exactly the one that
     	ought to be named AC_CHECK_TYPE: it just checks, and executes user
     	actions.  In the future, this macro ought to be renamed
     	AC_CHECK_TYPE.
    	There is a big difference with the former AC_CHECK_TYPE: instead
     	of grepping in the headers, it tries to compile a variable
     	declaration.  This is both safer, slower, and better, since now we
     	can check for compiler types (e.g., unsigned long long).
    	(AC_CHECK_TYPES): The looping and AC_DEFINEing version of the
     	previous macro.  Uses m4 loops.
    	(AC_CHECK_TYPE): Reimplemented on top of AC_CHECK_TYPE_INTERNAL.
      	* autoheader.m4 (AH_CHECK_TYPE, AH_CHECK_TYPES): New macros,
     	hooked.
    	* autoconf.texi (@ovar): New macro, for optional variables.
    	(Generic Typedefs): Document AC_CHECK_TYPES.
    	* autoheader.texi: (AH_CHECK_TYPE, AH_CHECK_TYPES): New macros.
    	(Epilogue): Hooks them.

    	create `conftest.defines' with the ac_d family, and then
    	`conftest.undefs' for the ac_e family.

    	Rename the family AC_NEED_DECL as AC_CHECK: it is more uniform,
    	but keep defining NEED_FOO_DECL when `foo' is not declared.  Files
    	not using Autoconf behave better when declarations lacks than when
    	they are wrong.  So the unset position should off, hence #if NEEDS
    	instead of #if !HAVE (which is triggered when HAVE is not set).
    
    	* acgeneral.m4 (AC_NEED_DECL): Renamed as...
    	(AC_CHECK_DECL): This.  Make sure the arguments are the usual
    	IF-FOUND, IF-NOT-FOUND.

    	Suggested by Alexandre Oliva.
    
    	* acgeneral.m4 (ifset): Renamed as...

    	the difference of AC_OUTPUT_COMMANDS, require that the set of
    	commands be named, so that both
    		CONFIG_COMMANDS=foo ./config.status
    	and
    		./config.status foo
    	perform the Right Thing.
    
    	* acgeneral.m4 (AC_CONFIG_UNIQUE): Also check in
    	AC_LIST_COMMANDS.
    	(AC_CONFIG_FILES): Remove a dead pushdef.
    	(AC_CONFIG_COMMANDS): New macro.
    	(AC_LIST_COMMANDS): New config list.
    	(AC_LIST_COMMANDS_COMMANDS): New growing string.
    	(AC_OUTPUT_COMMANDS_COMMANDS): New macro, output config commands
    	in config.status.
    	(AC_OUTPUT): Take AC_LIST_COMMANDS into account.
    	(AC_OUTPUT): Call AC_OUTPUT_COMMANDS_COMMANDS.

commit 5aa38da39b8b626c4f6232a224ca63e48874b8be
Author: Akim Demaille <akim@epita.fr>

    1999-10-31  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>
    
          New macro: AC_CONFIG_FILES which is very much like AC_OUTPUT but
          that one associates commands to run when a config file is
          created.  For instance for a shell script `foo', one uses
          AC_CONFIG_FILES(foo, chmod +x foo).
    
          In addition, check that the same name is never used twice in
          config files, headers, subdirs and links.
    
          * acgeneral.m4 (m4_append): Don't insert new line between
          elements.
          (m4_list_append): New macro.
          (AC_CONFIG_IF_MEMBER): New macro which tests if a file is member
          of a config list.
          (AC_CONFIG_UNIQUE): New macro which ensures that a config file
          name is not yet used.
          (AC_CONFIG_HEADER, AC_CONFIG_LINKS, AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS): Use
          AC_CONFIG_UNIQUE.
    
          * acgeneral.m4 (AC_CONFIG_FILES): New macro.
          (AC_LIST_FILES): New list, which stores arguments of
          AC_CONFIG_LISTS the same as AC_LIST_LINKS stores AC_CONFIG_LINKS
          etc.
          (AC_OUTPUT): No longer rely on $1 to designate the config files:
          register them via AC_CONFIG_FILES.  All uses of $1 replaced by
          uses of AC_LIST_FILES.
          (AC_OUTPUT_FILES): Run the commands associated to the
          CONFIG_FILES.

    	Make the handling of the configuration links (AC_LINK_FILES)

    1999-09-21  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>
    
    	* autoconf.sh (Checking for Bugs): Remove the indirection that
    	made the `sort -u' useless.
    
    1999-09-21  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>
    
    	* autoconf.sh (Last sed cmd): Change also @PND@ to `#', since this
    	is also a symbol very hard to quote in m4.
    
    1999-09-13  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>
    
    	* autoconf.sh: Substitute also /@BKL@/[/ /@BKR@/]/ /@DLR@/$/ so
    	that these characters are more easily accessible from m4 without
    	turning changequote juggling into a nightmare.

    1999-09-21  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>
    
    	* Makefile.in (${srcdir}/configure): Use autoconf.sh to build
    	Autoconf's configure.  Before the building was performed running

    Tue Nov 18 14:21:38 1997  Eric Mumpower  <nocturne@cygnus.com>
            * autoreconf.sh: Do the right thing when AC_CONFIG_HEADER is
            given more than one filename. As noted in the "Invoking
            autoheader" node of the info files, autoheader will use the first
            file argument given to AC_CONFIG_HEADER. Prior to this patch,
            autoreconf would end up executing incorrect shell code (e.g.
            "test ! -f 1.h 2.h.in") in such cases.
            Patch submitted in parallel to bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu.

Date:   Sat Mar 19 21:39:45 1994 +0000

    Update the file even if it is unchanged, to avoid foiling a
    Makefile rule that makes it from configure.in.
    If you let the rule for making config.status from configure
    create config.h from config.h.in, then an unnecessary update here
    will not cause unneeded recompilation.  Recompilation should only
    happen if config.h is updated, which won't occur if config.h.in
    had the same contents, even if its timestamp changed.  (Ick.)

    	* config.sub: Added machines and operating systems for Emacs
    	ports, since Emacs now uses config.sub for its configuration.
    	New manufacturers recognized not to be operating systems: High
    	Level Hardware (highlevel, defaults to using BSD), Gould
    	(gould, defaults to System V), Commodore (cbm, defaults to
    	amigados), National Semiconductor (ns, defaults to Genix), and
    	Masscomp (masscomp, defaults to RTU).
    	Recognize the NS1600 (ns16k) and the Clipper (clipper) as
    	processors.
    	Recognize these processors with default manufacturers: the
    	Cydra (cydra) from Cydrome (cydrome), the XPS100 (xps100) from
    	Honeywell (honeywell), and the Orion (orion) and Orion 1/05
    	(orion105) from High Level Hardware (highlevel).
    	If the ISC operating system is given with a version number,
    	don't kill it and set it to 2.2; just have it default to 2.2
    	if omitted.
    	Make Irix SGI's default operating system, not SYSV.
    	Make BSD Encore's default, so it applies for all Encore
    	machines, not just the umax and mmax abbreviations.
    	All of Encore's machines use BSD, not just the ns32k-based
    	ones.  Make it the manufacturer's default.
    	Make it possible to specify an operating system for a Gould
    	machine.  Make sysv the manufacturer's default, so it applies
    	when we specify the manufacturer as well as when we omit it.
    	Add Uniplus (uniplus), Iris (iris), Xenix (xenix), and RTU
    	(rtu) as recognized operating system names.
